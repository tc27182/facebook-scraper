"#48101 My lab partner always come unprepared and I am frustrated as fuck. How could someone be so irresponsible. If you are taking lab classes you need to know what you are going to do, not read the procedure in the lab time and waste other people's time. Gosh I wish I partnered with someone else. I'm losing my temper so much. This person sees my frustration, apologizes with no genuinity at all and worst of all, he asks if I can just move on into the future. At least an apology would do, honestly. I don't know what to do."

"#48086 In 7.016, I posted a Piazza question because after watching the lecture, it wasn't totally clear to me how two processes worked. I find that oftentimes the professors use inconsistent terminology (e.g. use term A to mean A, B, and C) without clarifying that this is what they mean. I guess this can just be the convention in biology, but they don't always acknowledge that this usage of the word is different than how the textbook and how they introduced it initially. For a student who JUST learned how Term A is defined, it can be quite confusing at times.

Anyways, one of the professors responded to the Piazza question, ""Both the polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis were clearly described in the lecture - please check your notes and the handouts.""

I'm not sure if the professor was just having a bad day or what, but this response was honestly pretty discouraging. I already feel scared to ask questions in office hours / recitation because I'm afraid of being judged for a dumb question. The professor is essentially saying that my question is SO stupid that they CANNOT FATHOM that a student who watched the lecture and reviewed handouts would ask this question...

Also, it really makes me feel like that professor doesn't care about the learning of her students. Instead of rewarding students who care enough to ask questions and reach out, she makes them feel ashamed.

Although this interaction with that specific professor sucked, my interactions with the rest of the course staff have been pretty good. A different instructor later edited the response and gave an actual explanation - shoutout to Moni (THANK YOU SO MUCH for answering all of my dumb questions on Piazza!!! Moni is the best y'all)"

#48084 ugh i just don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. could really use a week long break right about now
"#48083 I've started making a point of announcing to my family and close friends when I'm on my period. Especially the guys. There are a few reasons for this:

1. I've done a run-down with all of them about my crazy PMS and period symptoms. They know I'll be in a sensitive and fluctuating emotional state, and that I don't expect them to walk on eggshells during this time, but I might be slow to respond to messages or get irritated at them for small things. They know it's not their fault if I seem weirdly angry or sad, and I don't have to hide my emotions or give shabby excuses.

2. I want to normalize viewing the period as something normal and not taboo, and something that shouldn't be ridiculed. I hate whispering to girl friends about having cramps, I hate hiding my pads when going to the bathroom, I hate making up lies about why I'm crying or won't go swimming. Frank talk cuts down on the mental load of having a period, and makes sure everyone knows the reality of a period, not weird misinformed ideas and wild speculation. I'm not dumber or less reliable when I'm on my period. I'm just in pain and tired.

3. A culture of period acceptance requires catalysts. I'm fine being ""that weird friend who talks about her period too much"", because if I keep talking about it, the people around me will get more comfortable with it. Maybe they'll be more prepared and open when other people start talking about periods too, and maybe they'll be more inclined to engage. This is especially for my younger brothers, I shudder to think of them growing up to be misogynistic, clueless boyfriends.

4. No more ""you're acting weird today, you must be PMSing"". At least, no more feeling ashamed when I hear it. Yeah, I am PMSing, I already told you. I am acting weird. There's a biological explanation behind this mess. And now the people around me can't use that line to put me down. If I haven't said I'm PMSing, and I'm acting like a dick, just say I'm acting like a dick and we can talk about it without the misogynistic undertones.

Periods should not be taboo. This culture is why women go through life not knowing about period-related disorders, why men have all these dumb ideas about PMS, and why periods can be used to put women down and make them feel ashamed. There's no reason why periods should be harder than they already are, due to stupid societal norms.",I support you,Nassim Oufattole im pmsing next week u gotta be extra nice to me pls,Deekshita Kacham did I ghostwrite this?,Dyuti Chatterjee,Ipshita Maliat Rahman,Jenny Pan 1/2,Hitaishi Desai <3
"#48082 You ever just go to a national park, become absolutely infatuated, and want to stay there forever? I spent 2 weeks hiking with the most beautiful views I've ever seen and now there's like 90 more things I want to do in the park but it's a 5 hour flight and 4 hour drive from MIT so I won't be returning anytime soon. Normal life feels so dull and restrictive, I keep getting so excited reading about new trail openings and flower seasons then I look at my schedule and my bank account and realize I can't go back for a long time. I thought I liked engineering, but now the thought of living in a city working for some company makes me want to cry. I've never felt this way about anywhere else I've visited, it's like this national park came in and filled every missing part of my existence. I was actually waking up every morning excited to face the day, I completed all my psets 3 times faster than usual, my insomnia, anxiety, and perpetual exhaustion went away, I felt like I'd woken up for the first time in my life. It felt like the kind of life I hear neurotypicals talking about all the time, waking up happy and refreshed, accomplishing my daily goals, being productive while taking good care of my body and mind. Now I'm back at MIT and my life has returned to usual, and it fucking sucks. I'm tired, foggy, irritated, unhappy, I feel claustrophobic and mindless and purposeless and unproductive.

Mountain woman life, here I come.","Nature doesn't have have to be far or expensive OP! There's incredible natural beauty within ~2 hours of mit (the Whites, Berkshires/
Taconics and Greens). Within about 4 hours you have Acadia, the Adirondacks and all of Lake Champlain. Even closer, Cape Ann, the whole Plum Island/ipswich area, Wachusett and even the Fells, Blue Hills and Lake Cochichuate are pretty darn nice. It's about to be the most beautiful time of the year IMO - get outside!","i know this feel all too well. i was born and raised in a pretty outdoorsy place (Portland, OR) with tons of hiking and outdoorsy stuff, including an hour to the coast (over a small mountain range), three national parks within a 5 hour drive and the cascade mountains (with the PCT + other trails and wildernesses) in under 2 hours. i did a good deal of day hiking as a kid but i never got into backpacking before i turned 18 and left for MIT. however, i only knew it was a matter of time before i totally immersed myself in this.
when the pandemic sent us all home, it was devastating in one way, but knowing that i was basically back in my home state for good allowed me to embrace the side of me i lost at MIT. i bought new backpacking gear and got out there (Timberline Trail is one of the best trails in OR) and had the time of my life and now i know this is something that will be a part of my life until i die.
there are a good number of cities, especially in the western U.S, that host excellent jobs (engineering, or other STEM) while boasting quick access to all sorts of nature and outdoors. don‚Äôt give up on the dream!
i am an enviro engineering major so portland specifically is rlly good for that. but there are lots of tech companies in many west U.S cities including portland, seattle, phoenix, sf, la, salt lake city, boise, denver, etc. and in the east, although deep wilderness is harder to get to, boston is not half bad. durham, NC and the triangle there is also pretty good.
just do your research and plan your job/grad apps ahead of time, and there‚Äôs no reason that being an outdoorswoman can‚Äôt be part of your lifestyle.","You should really think about working for the National Park Service as soon as possible. They have some short-term programs too, I think, and it sounds like you would REALLY love it.","maybe it's a worthwhile goal to aim for a more rural lifestyle, even in the engineering profession. at first glance maybe that seems hopeless because cities are usually much higher in concentration, but there are probably organizations and companies out in rural areas dying for new talent and struggling to find it because popular opinion is that cities are where everyone is 'supposed to be'. you can do it.",How I feel like when I binge on a show or find a good game I can‚Äôt stop playing.

"#48081 I was cornered by some question today while helping students, as TAs do, but I didn't know how to solve thus problem using the tools the lecturer explained so far, so I pulled some old math tricks and told the students that I my variables and conventions are arbitrarily just to get the answer. Then the lecturer explain these same equation with the same definitions and conventions as fundamentally following from what we are doing.

Thanks to me many students now think everything about this class is arbitrary and only serve getting the arbitrary defined quantities for arbitrary purposes. They are not exactly wrong, but come on kids where your motivation at? Arbitrary stuff can still be interesting and worth your time!"

"#48075 As someone who took 6.036 3 springs ago and currently has access to the 6.036 materials, here's my assessment of the nanoquiz situation. We used to have these weekly 1-hour lab sessions with 20-minute nanoquizzes and 40-minute labs. The labs were these required things that were pretty similar to nanoquizzes, like you had to answer all the questions correctly before you left, but you could work with someone. And before you left, you had to check your answers and explain them to a TA, and if you got something wrong they'd tell you to keep working at it until you got it right. Old nanoquizzes were always stressful and fast as heck, and everyone would pretty much work till the clock hit zero without time to check answers. They were also autograded, pretty much in the same way they are now, with minimal partial credit.

The nanoquizzes are now 1-hour affairs that happen once every 2 weeks, and they're pretty long. They essentially look like 2 old-style nanoquizzes and maybe half a lab stuck together, which theoretically should take about 1 hour. The problem is that now, instead of having labs which actually help you practice for the next nanoquiz, a little bit of lab is now stuck to the quiz itself. And 1 hour of sustained stress just feels a lot worse than 20 minutes, and you lose a lot more points if you get stuck and can't finish. Even though the nanoquizzes have always been stressful as heck, each one contributed less to the grade so people didn't freak out as much about doing bad on them.

The class also now only has a final exam, and no midterm. So now, you have fewer nanoquizzes but the staff is trying to compensate for lab content and midterm content within those nanoquizzes, so the nanoquiz content is probably also a little harder, with a midterm-style (read: hard and mathy) question thrown in there. This contributes to the backwards 6.036 assessment style where exams are a lot harder than quizzes which are a lot harder than psets, and the 3 components are fairly orthogonal to each other in the material they cover, so you always feel unprepared for the level of difficulty thrown at you. Psets are low-pressure with unlimited submissions and mostly code, nanoquizzes are highly conceptual, and exams are math math math. The new nanoquiz style with both concept and math will probably prepare you better for the final exam, but now the cliff between psets and nanoquizzes is much higher than before.

Hang in there! I hope this helps explain why things are they way they are for all the confused folks in 6.036 rn.","Wait I also took 6.036 3 springs ago and I swear the nanoquizzes were only 10 minutes long. Rest of the description sounds accurate, though.

Even people with close to 5.0's have had academic setbacks and failed tests and things of that nature. 2 - It's a singular test, a blip within a larger scheme of things. Heck, I've gotten A's in classes in which I've failed tests. And even if that's not what happens out of this class, it's one test of one class in one semester of 8 semesters in one of many phases of your life. 3 - It's so easy to let these things get you down. There will be a push to give up. There will be a different push to repress. Acknowledge your disappointment/
anger/
sadness, and give yourself some time to grieve. But then try to perspectivize, realize that there's a road back from it. Maybe when you get it back (I guess since we're online, it's instant) analyze it and try to sense what happens. But most importantly, remember that a single exam, no matter how big a setback, is never insurmountable. Failing an exam does not make you a failure. It just means that that day, that exams material happened not to click. Self-care helps a lot in these moments, do something you enjoy so that the bright side of things comes to light again. If you're tired, get some sleep, and physically recover, which will help your mental recovery.

I'm already in physical pain every month, thanks for sticking an extra dollop of financial pain on there too. Dickheads.","Def try to see an obgyn if you can. Planned Parenthood is a good clinic to go to if you are uninsured or just short on funds in general because they have doctors on staff that can provide treatment for a reduced cost. Typically in situations like this they prescribe birth control to regulate hormones and symptoms, because it shouldn‚Äôt be so bad that you can‚Äôt function.

"#48050 I just wanted to post here to see if anyone else is feeling the same.

I was super motivated for about 2 weeks in the beginning of semester. I attended all my classes, participated, was actually enjoying life/learning, and taking care of myself. For some reason, lately that's all gone to shit. I don't sleep much but am not working when I'm awake, I have multiple missing assignments, and in general am feeling alarmingly lethargic/apathetic. I don't know if there's something seriously wrong with me or if I'm just being a baby and don't want to deal with the stress in a healthier/more effective way. I've also dropped classes that I was super excited about but quickly became disillusioned when I had to worry about what felt like a million other things at once.

I've talked to S^3 and some of my instructors, but I've gotten responses that have been less than understanding to say the least, and honestly it feels like those avenues just push off your work until later and postpone problems anyways.

I'm not sure if I got into this state because I had one bad week that just put me behind in everything and am now feeling hopeless about it, and I feel more stressed when I see people around me doing perfectly fine and being excited about new summer opportunities they have. Just wanted to see if I'm alone in this.",mood,No you are absolutely not alone,What's this S^3 you all talk to? Do you guys talk to other topological spaces as well????,"I'm not in MIT

"#48049 Ok why the fuck does it cost so much more to get a ""womens haircut"" than a ""mens haircut"" in most salons? I'm a woman with super short hair, yet I still get charged $60 for a haircut simply because I'm a woman while a man with the same fucking hairstyle as me gets charged $30. ""So why don't you go to a mens barbershop?"" I have gone to barbershops before, and believe it or not a lot of them still charged me more. And clearly there are some minor differences between pixie cuts and classic mens styles that I think fit my face better, but somehow it's SACRILIGEOUS to give me a pixie cut on mens prices even though it takes the exact same amount of time as any other short hairstyle. The ONLY haircut I've ever gotten which was priced fairly was at an LGBTQA+ barbershop in seattle that charged different prices for haircut lengths rather than gender, and I've never found another place that had that pricing model since.

I understand that long hair may be harder to deal with - more to wash, more to cut, more to blowdry, maybe more finicky - but we've moved past the age when only women had long hair and only men had short hair. I've seen men with hair halfway down their arms get charged ""mens prices"" while I'm sitting there with most of my hair getting shaved off with clippers still getting ""womens prices"". Ohhh suddenly shaving a woman's head is twice as hard as shaving a man's head? What's so hard about charging based on hairstyle instead of charging based on gender? Shit needs to change.","This has me hollering. As another person with pixi cut, this is extremely relatable. Now I am on the West coast and have more ‚Äúdata points,‚Äù queer owned salons definitely more commonly offer a ‚Äúgender neutral pricing‚Äù if you will. This for years caused me severe anxiety towards traditional salons that target and prey on people who feel trapped in a hyper-feminine framework.","I definitely paid the full women‚Äôs price to get my hair just fully buzzed off freshman year, I feel your pain. Like not even a shaped pixie cut, I‚Äôm talking one set of clippers all over, $40 or something","Blackroom Salon in the South End has a gender-neutral pricing scheme, but keep in mind that they charge downtown-Boston
prices, so you'll be paying more than $30.","I want to cut my own hairs but panik over what if it will go long, rn I am home but when I shift to hostel again, I will put a poster outside my door, I uneven hairs won't kill you, and you want to save money I will cut your hairs.",i paid $60 for a haircut at a womens salon and it was pure shit 0/10 would never go back,Why? Because Women will pay it and a lot of guys won‚Äôt. If the cheapest haircut in town was $30 a lot of guys just gonna get a cheap set of clippers and d-I-y that shit (or ask a woman in their life to do it).,"My last haircut w/ three colors: $350

"#48048 I'm a junior who can still graduate by my senior spring, but lowkey I've been really considering taking a 9th semester or even a full extra year just for the hell of it. I spent my first two years of MIT struggling with my mental health (and being lazy as fuck lmao), and as a result I feel like I really missed out on having a full experience here (i.e. going to more events, meeting new people, taking cool classes for fun, participating in MIT sponsored programs, not dealing with COVID this year, etc).

I'm just kinda worried about how will recruiters look at it if I end up looking for an summer internship as a senior, or looking for a full time job as a super senior? Or how to tell my advisor? Will he force me to graduate? How does financial aid work in your fifth year/ how much does it get cut? How does socializing work if most of my friends graduate? Is this even a good idea?","I do not recommend taking an extra year for financial reasons (lost salary potential, plus it will affect your aid -- they'll rarely grant aid unless it's necessary) but I will say I graduated over a year late and nobody noticed or gave a sh*t.

Also iirc you can now take terms off for internships or study abroad and whatnot without penalties or difficulty getting back in. Dk how that actually panned out but that was the policy they were starting to implement when I graduated. So if you really wanted more time before heading into the real world that's what I'd do... if study abroad is a thing that interests you there are even scholarships that would cover that for a term or year.","If possible, do a 5th year masters through your department! Several offer them","No one cares how many years you take, but best case you're borrowing $50k+ for that 5th year and losing out on a year of income.

#48041 I think that grade transparency can be improved at MIT and I like the idea of a six week flag for everyone but I'm afraid that instructors of large classes who already have a ton of work could get overwhelmed with grade justification requests (especially in some majors where all As are important.) also setting letter grade cutoffs for each major assignment instead of at the end of the semester could prevent professors from having the flexibility to bump up a student's grade or increase the curve for the whole class at the end of a semester. i think there's ways of rewording the second point while still allowing for end of the semester flexibility. what do you all think?,I had this concern also. That professors would feel forced to come up with grading scales by the time of the ‚Äúflag‚Äù and not have the flexibility to add a curve at the end because they have to stick to their word,Just do away with grades and report marks out of a 100 as a percentage? (Also setup reasonable exams so that half people don‚Äôt get a 12/100 and have that be a B.),"Hey op! I worked on this with people in the UA, and I wanted to give some reasoning for why I still support grade justification (even at the expense of flexibility at the end of the semester).

I think, for me, one of the biggest issues with not being transparent (and with not having to justify the grades you assign) is that professors aren't forced to challenge their grading conceptions. I'm a math major, and a lot of my classes (starting from my freshman spring) were graded based on some conception of effort. Professors insisted that if I gave a good effort in a class, then I would have a grade that reflected that work.

Now, this isn't a bad practice in theory, but I think that things like implicit bias comes into play. When a professor, without meaning to, falls into stereotypes about women, poc, and other marginalized groups in STEM, how does this affect the way that they perceive effort?

I had an experience my sophomore year that really shaped the way I think about this as well. A professor assumed I was a freshman feeling homesick when I asked for an extension, and implied that I wasn't trying hard enough in his class. In reality, I was going through a difficult Title IX investigation, and was consistently dismissed (despite having S^3 and VPR backing me up). How much of his assumptions relied on me being female? What about me being Mexican? Why did he assume I was a freshman? What did that mean for my final grade?

My experience is in no way unique. I wonder how often professors who misgender their students, say racist things, etc. are making unfounded assumptions on the effort their students are putting into a class. Ultimately, I think, it's difficult to maintain a consistent grading pattern when professors are allowed complete flexibility for the grades they assign. I also hope that they think critically before assigning a student a certain grade, so that if they are asked about it they'll have an answer. For the large classes (GIRs, etc.), they can also add this into a syllabus (a ""how is your grade calculated?"" section maybe?).

Thanks for the critical thinking about the petition though! I wanted to detail my experiences for anyone that's on the fence about it, but ultimately, your concerns are valid. It's my hope that being held accountable won't mean that professors are stuck with too strict guidelines, but that could be a faulty belief. Here's the link for anyone wondering about the petition as well: tiny.cc/

You got this friend üíï","Females with ADHD are generally slow to diagnose I was 40. I'd developed some decent coping skills on accident (knit during class, clip keys to clothing, get up early to finish work, rather than staying up in the night - that last one does sometimes backfire, but I'm way more productive on a tight deadline when I can more easily convince myself that this IS the most important thing to be doing RIGHT NOW.). That said, I would have gotten thei through my life more smoothly with earlier coaching and meds. . .","Hi OP! Sorry to hear you‚Äôre having difficulty with ADHD symptoms... as someone who was diagnosed post MIT I totally feel for you right now. It is important to see a psychiatrist who can diagnose you, as there are overlaps of symptoms in many disorders (ie anxiety, depression, etc). A psychiatrist will be able to provide helpful tips for managing ADHD (or other disorders), and can prescribe medication if necessary. I‚Äôm sorry that MIT wrote you off and that shouldn‚Äôt be the case, so it might be helpful to go without the expectation/
ask of being prescribed something (or you could seek an external psychiatrist if your insurance covers it).

In terms of coping mechanisms, some things that I‚Äôve found helpful are making to-do lists, and if I procrastinate I try to procrastinate by doing something else that I won‚Äôt regret later (like cleaning my room or painting my nails instead of surfing Facebook). Something that I‚Äôve also found helpful is noise cancelling headphones, setting timers to make sure I don‚Äôt stay distracted too long, and making sure everything I own has a ‚Äúplace‚Äù it belongs to avoid losing stuff. Feel free to PM me if you‚Äôd like to chat/vent/etc üôÇ","Your experience with MIT Mental sounds par for the course. The ADHD specialist there seems to decide whether or not you're worthy of being taken seriously the moment you walk in, and if not, she just defaults to giving generic study tips (""Have you tried highlighting?"")
and demeaning every struggle you mention. It's really a shame, because her online interviews and whatnot made her sound like...someone whose knee-jerk reaction wouldn't be to assume that you're seeking perfection or want drugs.

Unfortunately, from what I recall, she's the only specialist there. I ended up having to call back and explain to the receptionist that she made me feel uncomfortable, and they arranged for me to see one of the psychiatrists instead.","yo op! i'm a female with mixed type adhd (diagnosed in hs) and would love to share strategies for effective neurodivergent study/work habits and also social habits i've found work for me if u wanna PM me!! i definitely have spent a lot of time this last year reflecting and reassessing + reworking my habits and routine as remote learning and working have def made learning and working with adhd even harder + brought up new challenges for me. also @ anyone else who's reading thru the comments looking for advice to deal with similar issues totally feel free to PM too. ik even my neurotypical friends and i talk about our strategies to approach remote learning/
working, as i think many many people are feeling the strain amidst the virtual shift the pandemic has caused.","Sorry that you had to go through this. Consider seeking out alternatives that may be able to provide you with the healthcare you need. I‚Äôve heard that Hello Ahead (https://
www.helloahead.c
om/) is a good and comprehensive resource on ADHD. It may be a start",What a mood.,"Hiyo! I started typing up a comment this morning but well, got distracted so here we are now. I had the exact same experience (not quite all As haha but I had been doing fine) with the (single) MIT Mental Health ADHD specialist, and based off the other comments we‚Äôre not alone. I came out of that appointment feeling like I hadn't been listened to and dismissed. It's been really frustrating, especially since my friends with ADHD, my S^3 dean, and my therapist and psychiatrist at Mental Health all think that I probably have it after seeing me a few times, but since the one specialist MIT has for ADHD didn't think so from our meeting, I've been stuck without the relief of a diagnosis.

One resource I really like is this YouTube channel: https://
www.youtube.com/
channel/
UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZG
kcgy_95Q, especially the How To Do The Thing playlist. She's especially helpful in:
1. making you feel like you're not alone, that these things you've struggled with aren't your fault,
2. give you the knowledge to understand and explain what you're feeling/going through, through analogies and terminology, and pinpoint how a particular thing is related to having ADHD
3. (in most videos) listing actionable steps on strategies/
techniques that work with your ADHD and not against it.
Even if the ADHD specialist is right and I don't have ADHD, the tips and strategies still help anyone who's struggling to get things done.

I have a lot more to say about what I‚Äôve tried and what‚Äôs worked for me personally, other resources, also more on my experience at MIT Medical, so please DM me if you want to hear more, or just chat."
"#48021 My longtime urop PI just refused to give me a rec letter with no explanation and I can only conclude that it was because I reached out to them to talk about some mental health and financial issues I went through during covid. I feel like I did good work, I'm coauthor on a few papers, I've stayed late in the lab and showed up on weekends to help with stuff. I had a bad semester in there when I was so depressed I let urop duties fall by the wayside, but the rest of the time I worked really hard at the expense of sleep and classes.

I feel pretty betrayed and sad that ""professors won't penalize you in your rec letters if you reach out to them"" is just another empty bit of rhetoric. The truth is, even if 95% of professors really do care and won't penalize you, they look exactly the same as the 5% with poor intentions. I know now that it's not worth my future to reach out and reveal my imperfections to professors and authority figures anymore, especially if my future relies on their subjective evaluation of my character. All I can do now is scoop up my pride and keep my problems to myself from now on.","While that totally sucks, it's at least short of agreeing to write without telling you they plan to write a bad letter. . .","I am sorry that you had this bad experience. Regarding your last line, it is helpful to keep in mind for the next steps in life that it is essential to have a manager/
faculty advisor you can talk to about life hurdles. If you feel they are not that type of manager/
advisor, maybe it is time to find a new one (if possible).","That is utter horseshit. I'm sorry. I hope you have a coauthor or an intermediate-le
vel supervisor who can write you one.",Please ask your grad student supervisor. They can write you letters too.,help me coauther something pls:(,Tell me who ur urop pi is I just wanna talk
"#48020 I'm tutoring for 6.036 this semester and holy crapoli I forgot how fast the material goes by. I've tutored in other classes before (6.003, 6.0001, 6.009) and usually I spend <1 hour every week prepping and refreshing myself on the material, and the tutees will show up with pretty specific questions that I can answer without a hitch. But for 6.036, the tutees are so confused they can't even formulate specific questions so I end up having to prepare a whole lesson plan and basically give a condensed lecture on all the material the real lecture didn't cover. My average prep time for this class has been 4-5 hours a week, because there's just So. Much. Material. And the tutees always pop surprise questions about derivations and proofs so I end up having to write out pages and pages of these fucking derivations every week that are never ever provided in the actual lectures. If you're gonna teach ML from a mathematical perspective, you kinda have to explain the math for newbies to understand the big concepts, no?

I love ML and I've been looking forward to tutoring in 6.036 but it's been a stressful, time-consuming nightmare. I'm sad, the tutees are sad, everyone's having a bad time. Not to mention I stupidly put my tutoring on volunteer hours this semester so I don't get a lick of compensation for all the prep work I do (volunteer hours only count for face-to-face time, which is like 20% of my tutoring workload). Sure, deriving every equation by hand is really giving me a deep-dive review into basic ML concepts, but at what cost?

I don't want to let my tutees down but honestly this has been such a time-sink that I'm considering just quitting once I'm done with my volunteer hours. Sure, it would be swell to get paid, but tutoring this class is draining my time and mental health. I feel like this class really needs a revamp as a whole, maybe at the bare minimum some additional and actually enforced prereqs or a short optional IAP class that goes over some math and ML programming fundamentals. Or at least change the expectations for the class, people seem to be going in blind to the fact that they'll be thrown in the deep end, and everyone involved is paying for it.",Alessandre Santos,Kevin Z Chen

"#48017 I don't think MIT has realized what it's done by killing spring break... everyone I know is slipping further and further behind and starting to cut assignments and take all nighters and turn in worse and worse work... having a day or two off here or there doesn't do shit when the grind doesn't stop week over week. Spring break would actually put a pause on work, usually with exams held before it and few new assignments until after it -- we actually got a reprieve.

"#48013 how do yall get personal projects done?
i feel like i have ideas and never the follow through","honestly this is really hard. The only personal projects/new ideas I've ever completed in some degree are the ones I literally couldn't stop thinking about, and even then it often took me months over my target time (just because I'm thinking about it doesn't mean I'm doing it...oops).

1. Breaking it down into chewable goals, taking say 1-2 hrs each. If you aren't sure shoot for more conservative or smaller goals, if you find urself taking less time build it up.
2. Give urself deadlines. Make your friends try to remind you of them. Make your friends _expect your getting an outcome_, if possible. Some personal things I did were finished because my friends who looked at the progress were really hyped about seeing the final product + motivated me along the way.
3. Realism. Most things are harder than they look, there's always way more to learn. This doesn't mean shy away from hard projects, but instead to break down projects into more steps than you think it'll take and be more forgiving on yourself when stuff doesn't work out.
4. Losing motivation is ok! You don't have to finish everything you start. I think by starting some personal projects you can have a better idea about what you care about and what is fun to you -- and if something just isn't fun or interesting, it's fine to let that go. Finding and prioritizing something you really care about after trial and error is better motivation to finish than a sense of guilt that you can't finish things","While this is more geared towards artsy creative folks, I would argue it applies to any and all personal projects - and that technical personal projects are very creative

also if a gentle voiced and kind british lady with a ton of creativity & expertise giving you motivation via the internet appeals to you

By all means, that is available a la Cathy Hays - a precious part of the internet

like I'm frenzied finding new people on insta and fb and trying to see if they're down for walks, and everyone else seems to just be vibing and are out of their dorms for pretty much all of the weekend.

how?????",Also down for walks!! I like meeting new folks :0,"Hey OP, so I'm not an MIT student nor a freshman but all my classes so far have been remote and I definetly have a few tips about how you can make friends remotely or irl. Often I found the best way to meet new people was in classes. Often I would dm people and people would dm me and together we would form a study group with other people. Study groups are fantastic especially for difficult classes because they help solidify bonds between classmates and then they are more likely to want to hang out with you after class or work in a more social setting. A lot of people have commented on campus groups and those as well are certainly very helpful (especially when you discover clubmates are also in your same class and then ur stuck together at 2am trynna submit a PSET tgt heheh). But I do wish you the best of luck OP because it's certainly not easy in this online format but with a lil bit of perseverance and luck you will get there !","some people will make friends just by existing. some people will not. sometimes, you're in that latter category, and you'll just have to live with it.",Join intramural groups/teams or in my case pester my pod and my other 3 friends,i‚Äôm down for walks! message me :)),Dm me if u wanna go on walks!

"#48006 As an instructor who used to be a student here, I'm a little worried about y'all. You seem really stressed, even more so than normal. (And to be honest, it makes sense. I cannot imagine going through college right now; teaching is hard enough). But... in all seriousness, how can I help? How can an instructor let you know that you *can* approach if you are having a hard time ‚Äì in fact, the sooner the better ‚Äì and it won't be held against you or negatively affect a rec letter? What would encourage you?","tell your students that they can/should approach you if they‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed and when they do, ACTUALLY do something about it. i‚Äôve had experiences where a prof is like ‚Äúomggg y‚Äôall must be going through such a hard time let me know how i can help‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù but then they assign long ass psets/terrible exams and aren‚Äôt flexible about extensions. hypocrisy hurts","Two of my professors say almost every lecture smth like ""if you feel like an extension would be useful to you, please don't hesitate to ask"" and I feel like the phrasing of ""an extension would be useful to you"" feels better to me than ""if you need an extension"" and that wording encourages me/makes me more ok with being behind and needing an extension.

In addition, one of my classes has the policy where you can submit a Google form at least 24 before a deadline and you will get a 24 hour extension automatically. On that very form, they say that if we'd like more time, we can ask for it and it will likely be granted. I think this method of having a very real and easy and accessible extension request strongly encourages me to consider taking an extension when it would be useful to me. In my other classes, it always feels a bit more intimidating/
higher activation energy to write an email to my Prof and explain my situation and that I'd like an extension.","Being understanding of workload is definitely the best thing.

"#48004 People who have ADHD: do your friends know?

As a child, my parents told me to not tell anyone.

I personally don‚Äôt care, but strangely I‚Äôve had several conversations discussing ADHD and other things without mentioning the fact that I have it.","My friends know, tbh I don‚Äôt mind telling people as it might help other people understand ADHD or their own experiences","For me, even though I‚Äôm not an MIT student, mentioning it is better because that way, other people don‚Äôt have unrealistic expectations of you.","I mention it if its relevant context to something I'm saying, but I generally don't bring it up on its own","oh i tell pretty much anyone so that if i have to take my meds at a meal or something, they don't automatically assume i have a drug problem and then report me without talking to me first.",Everyone knows in my experience.

#48000 Is GEL worth the extra time/effort? Pls share your experience good or bad :‚Äô),"I'm currently in the second year of GEL and I'd definitely say that it was worth it. The first and second years of the program are pretty different but regardless, I'd recommend anyone who's a junior or senior in the school of engineering and interested in working on their leadership and teamwork skills to apply for the first year (early deadline is next Sunday, April 11th). I'm happy to talk about it more if OP - or anyone really - wants to DM me about it, but i found the staff and program overall to be really helpful and help me become even more reflective on my own leadership styles and how I personally function within a team setting, as well as how to adjust for different situations that i might encounter in a future career in engineering, or even during the rest of my time at MIT. Again, happy to talk more about it with anyone that's interested!!",GEL has been suuuper useful for me at work 11/10 would recommend. Most scenarios we cover in lab have applied so far!,"GEL is definitely a ""you get out of it what you put into it"" kind of program, and if you decide to put a lot into it then it's 110% worth it. It's a really unique program and can help guide you toward becoming a more effective leader and teammate ‚Äî but it's not magic and none of that will happen if you aren't willing to engage and work hard.

For me, it was absolutely worth it. Within a couple of years of working in industry, it became clear to me that the limiting factor on most people's career trajectory wasn't technical knowledge, but effectiveness at applying that knowledge as part of a team. Top performers aren't the people that write the most code or that build the best things. They are the people that can find and solve the problems a company faces ‚Äî the code-writing and thing-building are merely tools used to solve those problems, and they are rarely solo activities. I didn't fully appreciate this when I took GEL, but in retrospect GEL left me incredibly well-prepared for it.","I've absolutely loved my time as a GEL1.

"#47981 I feel pathetic because I have no good justification as to why I'm so unproductive all the time. Plenty of other people achieve more than me under much worse conditions, but here I am just lying in bed for five hours a day because I 'just don't feel like it'. I should be working, studying, literally doing anything of any merit, but instead I do nothing. (and I know that other people are doing more than me because I see them working their asses off everyday while I whine and feel sorry for myself in my room)",It's not a problem if someone is not feeling to do something. Completely okay. We all are different. There is nothing wrong if we achieve less than others. It is not a competition.,"""I just don't feel like it"" is a valid reason. As someone with depression, I can relate","In addition to seeking treatment for depression, one thing that might help is getting in the habit of doing small / easy ""productive"" things, then seeing if they help you build momentum. E.g. get out of bed and sit in a chair; that way you won't be in bed all day. Or step outside your room and walk down the hall -- commit to going to the end of the hall and back, and if you feel up to it afterward, you can walk some more. (Or go back into your room if you prefer.) You want the thing you commit to, to be easy enough that you actually do it. But once you start, it's easier to continue than if you never started in the first place.","See a therapist and try antidepressants
. I used to think everyone felt this way, then I got pharmacological

Recognizing the problem is the first step to fixing it. It‚Äôs like AA, you need to first acknowledge your drinking problem.

In terms of time management, I find two things helpful.

1) write out your five goals/five things that are most important to you. Then track your time spent for a couple weeks. What are five things you spend the most time on aside from sleep? Those two lists better have some overlaps.

"#47946 I‚Äôm really afraid that our economy got obliterated so much more than we think. As a senior, it was so much harder to find a job than I expected. There were so many companies that weren‚Äôt even recruiting this year. My parents had their work hours cut down and other people in my family lost their jobs and are struggling to find new ones due to everything being shut down. Maybe I‚Äôm being selfish cause covid is obviously a much bigger issue, but I have actual panic attacks whenever people tout the possibility of more covid lockdowns due to rising cases or new strains. I truly hope that things will actually return to normal once covid is under control, but I have absolutely no idea how that‚Äôll happen.","Economically, it‚Äôll be bad for quite a while. Businesses that closed really won‚Äôt come back. Their owners were bankrupted, what capital they had probably burned up from rent-seeking. Nor will new people be eager to try to start businesses after this, because their personal savings are likely trashed and, most importantly, they‚Äôve seen firsthand how willing governments at every level are to nonchalantly destroy their livelihoods without compensation. Many landlords have been screwed themselves by tenants under eviction moratoriums, so in the future they‚Äôll account for that by charging still higher rents, which will just drive people away. Expensive commercial property has lost a ton of its value now that companies increasingly embrace remote work indefinitely. That‚Äôs real value in the economy, that‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs money that would have flowed around that now won‚Äôt. The attempts to fix it will probably drive inflation, which we see already in many sectors (*cough*stockma
rket*cough*) and that‚Äôll also probably hurt.","If you look at the income/career of people who graduated in 08, there was permanent damage.

Careers unfortunately, is to a degree path dependent. If you don‚Äôt get on from the normal on ramps, it takes a lot more effort later. Not impossible, just much harder."

"#47941 The MIT pet policy reads as follows: ""Pets are prohibited in any undergraduate or graduate residence hall. The term ‚Äúpet‚Äù includes mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians....""

All humans are mammals, and so by this language, humans would count as a ""pet"", which are forbidden. Thus, we can only conclude that humans are prohibited from the residence halls. This sounds concerning to us humans, but this policy is actually quite generous! In particular, it permits animals such as:

- non-vertebrate chordates such as sea squirts, starfish, and tunicates
- molluscs such as squids and snails
- annelids such as earthworms and leeches
- arthropods such as:
---- insects such as flies, ants, beetles, and butterflies
---- arachnids such as spiders
---- myriapods such as centipedes and millipedes
---- crustaceans such as shrimps and lobsters
- poriferae such as sponges

I have seen plenty of people do it off campus with people who don't even go here, and aren't even on covid pass. would it not be more practical and safe to have sex with other people on campus??? so here's my proposal, to limit the frequency with which this happens, while allowing those who need an outlet to have one: if you want to take advantage of my new policy, you have to go up to the front desk worker at that dorm, and state your intentions. the person with which you plan to have sex must also be there to let you in. one person can only invite in one other person at a time for sex, and you have 3 hours (PLENTY of time) before the front desk people have full license to bang on the door and kick you out. thank you for listening to my proposal.","Damn, OP horny on mainüò¢","‚Äúbang on the door‚Äù ,, this can be misinterpreted",beautiful,this is unbelievably valid,Michael Mandanas they cant stop us forever,Nicolas Suter,Lukas Brink stop posting this stupid stuff...,Shayna Ahteck,Nicholas Crowther,Brandon Escobedo

"#47924 I started watching some old OCW lectures and oh my god. The issue this semester isn't the online format of classes.

When a class is taught using slides (even back when it was in person) that means that the Prof can (1) go too fast for anyone to write notes or process information and (2) doesn't have to really prepare for lecture.

"#47921 Lol all these freshmen/sophomore/juniors are now suddenly screaming into the void about how depressing campus life is. Now imagine being on campus except it's a literal fucking ghost town, your hall contains a total of 3 people including your pod, all your friends are living off campus, covidpass is still in shitty beta mode, you keep getting locked out of buildings for no reason, they keep shortening the covid testing hours because of low demand, and the food contains plastic, nail clippings, misplaced rotting vegetable scraps, and spiders for 2 months straight until MIT finally responds to dangerous dining conditions. The front desk leaves you standing outside in the dark in 20 degree weather for an HOUR because you forgot to take your covid test and they haven't been trained on what to do. Your off-campus friends keep saying ""at least you get covid tests lol"" when you complain about how fucking lonely you are. You have to move off campus in the busiest week of the semester but 85% of the population isn't doing that so your professors assign work as usual with no mercy. Nobody sympathizes, nobody advocates for you. All you get are emails telling you to get the fuck out. ""Nobody's"" on campus so every lab class is virtualized anyways due to low demand.

I know what you guys are going through, and I sympathize, but at the same time, yall minimized my struggles during the fall, saying how amazing being on campus must be, ignoring my loneliness. You told me to not complain about the little bugs and inconveniences, just being on campus was a priceless privilege. Now you go back to a significantly improved and streamlined system, with significantly more livable conditions, with the same exact restrictions as we had, with the light visible at the end of the tunnel, with a lot more solidarity from your peers. And you complain, you message me incessantly saying how depressed you are, how terrible the restrictions are, how awful campus life is. And you say how nice it must be to be off-campus without restrictions. Yeah okay. aT lEaSt YoU gEt TeStEd RiGhT. sToP cOmPlAiNiNg It'S a PrIvElEgE.

FUCKING CHEESE!","I can't believe how many parents are justifying this level of intrusion.

How shitty do you have to be at parenting that you don't feel you can trust your child to function as an autonomous being? Are you just fully admitting that you have failed at the core obligation of parenting: to instill in your child the skills and knowledge required to function as an independent adult? By continuing to exercise this level of control over your child, you are telling them that they cannot be trusted to make responsible decisions and to self-regulate appropriately. If that is the case, then you have failed completely as a parent and should be thoroughly ashamed.

There's a difference between concern and control, and those who have suffered from an abundance of the latter tend to fare much worse independently and harbor an incredible amount of resentment toward their parents.

I feel very sorry for OP and all others in this situation.
OP, I hope you are able to reclaim some level of autonomy by working something out with the offices there. Your mental health matters and it is none of your parents' business. You are protected by HIPAA and the offices there are required to make arrangements to accommodate you in order to preserve your privacy. Even if you are accessing mental health or other healthcare services under your parents' insurance, there are ways to keep your personal health information out of their hands by speaking with your insurance provider (if you are over 18). As a survivor of intrusive parenting, I am happy to help if you have any questions.","For everyone insisting that as long as a student's parents are paying their tuition, they're entitled to know about the student's mental health appointments, no they aren't, so please stop spreading misinformation.

An educational agency or institution may only disclose an eligible student‚Äôs treatment records to individuals who are providing treatment to the student (including health care professionals who are not part of, nor acting on behalf of, the educational agency or institution (e.g., third-party health care providers)), and a physician or other appropriate professional of the student‚Äôs choice.

For all other disclosures of an eligible student‚Äôs treatment records, an educational agency or institution must obtain the student‚Äôs prior written consent or satisfy one of the exceptions to FERPA‚Äôs general written consent requirement, as the records would no longer qualify as ‚Äútreatment records‚Äù (and thereby be excluded from the definition of ‚Äúeducation records‚Äù) and, instead, become subject to all other FERPA requirements.

I'm sorry but wtf is the point of 4 day breaks if the classes are gonna assign work to be due the day after. Like... damn these 4 days you either actually have a break or just continue to work your ass off just to catch up a little bit. As a freshman, idk if this is how it usually is tbh but regardless it kinda sucks. I literally don't know what to do in half of my classes (specifically 14.01, which is it's own story, and 6.042). I don't know what to do right now. Especially when I don't know which class to use PE/NE on. This whole year was hell for me and tbh idk if anything couldve made it better. I barely made any friends (which tbh i really was looking forward too bc high school was it's own thing) and i'm not doing particularly well in classes. I'm in a bunch of extracurriculars that I'm into and tbh thats all i look forward to nowadays. I don't trust people outside of my pod (especially since there are those kids going to New York into crowded subways and then getting the vaccine just days after that...) so I just kinda hunker down in my dorm and wait for the days to pass. I'm not saying it's absolutely horrible (i'm lucky enough to keep myself busy) but i know FOR SURE it could've been so so so much better. So yeah, fuck this school year and I hope i can get my life together before the end of this week.

"#47894 (TW Suicide) Can I make a PSA that you can talk about being suicidal with MIT Medical. I've been going for two years, I've been suicidal the whole time, and they are very aware. I have never been sent to a psych ward, because my doctor and I speak at length about how I can stay safe, and if my suicidality is intense enough that it will translate to action.

If I wasn't able to share this part of my mental health with my doctor, I would feel infinitely worse (and tbh a decent chance I wouldn't be here at all). Being suicidal is something that is scary to deal with, and when you deal with it alone, it eats away at you until you feel like a shell of a person. It has been immensely helpful to have a space that I can be honest about my feelings and get constructive advice on how I can feel better and understand my triggers. If you are feeling suicidal, please take the leap of faith that mental health staff are there to help you, not lock you away in a psych ward.",Alyssa Charlotte

Also, a genuine curiosity to learn about different things and explore intellectually will serve you so much better during grad school than just trying to get As.

"#47890 Hot take: mental health has actually been really well taken care of for me at MIT. I didn‚Äôt have access to care locally, and it‚Äôs been a relief to have MIT medical as an option. I don‚Äôt really feel like admin itself gives any shits beyond me not being a statistic on their reputation, but individual students, teachers, and staff have been so kind and supportive to give me whatever I need to take care of myself. I can just shoot an email and get an extension, and all of my other friends‚Äô colleges have way more barriers to that sort of flexibility. Sure classes are challenging, but I always have friends to vent to or older students to help (I recognize that‚Äôs a privilege I‚Äôm lucky to have, since it‚Äôs hard to build connections right now in COVID restrictions).
I think a lot of the reason for MIT‚Äôs bad rep with mental health is a result of the selection of people who come here. A lot of us are already mentally ill or coming from high stress environment, and it all just sorta collapses when we undergo a big change like college. I genuinely don‚Äôt think I would have survived if I went somewhere else.
I don‚Äôt want people to be terrified of going here because of mental health! It‚Äôs stressful sure, but the problems we experience here are not unique. College is universally a hard time.

"#47889 cw: suicidal thoughts

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable responding publicly, but I do have info for the person who asked about suicidal thoughts and MIT medical. You actually can talk to someone at MIT medical about suicidal thoughts without being hospitalized, and I encourage you to discuss them if you‚Äôre able to. I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts off and on for 2 years and I‚Äôve been upfront with my psychiatrist about them and I haven‚Äôt been involuntarily hospitalized. There‚Äôs a distinction between suicidal thoughts and self harm/suicidal plans. Unfortunately it‚Äôs a more common thing to *casually* have suicidal thoughts with depression then people talk about, and just get by day by day pushing down those thoughts. So I would definitely talk to whoever you have at MIT medical as honestly as you can, and if they do determine that you need to be hospitalized then it is truly a necessity to keep you safe. You need to get the best help you can, and it‚Äôs hard to heal if you aren‚Äôt being honest about how much you‚Äôre hurting"
"#47888 Why did MIT have to impose such unreasonably strict rules on us? This might seem incredibly selfish and cynical, but yeah, I really would rather see a couple more people get severe COVID that watch how at least 20% of the student population is getting their mental well-being destroyed beyond return.

Each day is getting more depressing by the minute. I am completely burned out from being with the same 5 people every day and from not being able to hug my other friends. We don't even have excuses to meet that often, we aren't going together to class, there are no events at which we can meet up, and just going out for any other reason seems worthless.

I am completely burned out that every member in my pod is going through mental hardship and there's no resource I can offer to help them and myself. S^3 don't understand our struggles and haven't been helpful. MIT Medical is completely overloaded. We haven't been given any resources to nagivate MIT life under the pandemic.

I am completely burned out by the long weekend that are supposed to be breaks. They were more exhausting than weeks where I would work 6+h/d on my classes, because that‚Äôs when everyone‚Äôs feelings start to hit them and that‚Äôs when every one of us is at their worst mentally.

And I am completely fucking burned out that all of these rules have been for nothing, that absolutely nothing positive came out of my extended suffering, because, everyday people are acting like we aren't in a pandemic and break absolutely guideline. Not just ocassionally break a rule here. Act like the rules don't exist. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if MIT being such a joke with their policies made them act that way.",">This might seem incredibly selfish and cynical, but yeah, I really would rather see a couple more people get severe COVID.. yeah that sounds incredibly selfish; this style of thinking is wrong, but I do agree MIT should provide better mental health resources.

They sound like they get why the restrictions are there but they are also miserable because of it. It can be both.

"#47873 Covid and online school has absolutely destroyed my mental health. Since the start of the fall semester, after a virtual summer internship, I've been experiencing constant burn out without any feeling of a real enjoyable reset. No matter what people say, MIT over zoom objectively sucks and is not a true MIT experience. I wish MIT were like 99% of other normal schools in this country and have more reasonable policies surrounding covid, but no, the administration needs to take a fake moral high ground to the detriment of its students. What also annoys me is my fellow classmates condemning me and lecturing me for saying this - I have every right to believe that MIT has gone too far in its covid restrictions and is extremely draconian, usually against the interests of its students. It's a completely valid opinion to think restrictions go too far.

Wanna talk science? There's no reason undergrads off campus shouldn't be allowed on if they adhere to the same testing requirements that other students do (yes, there's always the few idiot undergrads who party but the Sloanies did that too last semester). Grad students live off campus without any restrictions of who they can see. Of course, MIT and Harvard are the only schools I know of with policies like this. MIT is one of the only schools not participating in NEWMAC, despite the virtually nonexistent risk of catching covid outside with masks on. Playing on a large outdoor field is not a high risk activity by any means, but MIT largely got rid of competitive sports anyway.

I put on a good facade but I am having an awful time. Every day feels exactly the same with class online and constantly working. I go outside way less often and see people much less - and a virtual zoom hang out is not at all the same. I do work nonstop because I never have time to relax and go outside and it feels like a never ending stream. These 1-2 day extra days off suck. It's not like a real spring break where I can have a true reset and have some time to cool down - I just spend these days catching up on work I've missed since I'm under so much stress (this is the case for lots of my friends at other schools who have ""wellness days""). I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel with vaccines, but I feel that MIT is still going to have ridiculously restrictive policies even if the entire student population is vaccinated in the name of ""science"". I wouldn't be surprised if MIT still had tons of policies despite nearly everywhere around us going completely back to normal and it scares me that another year of my time here is going to suck. For me, MIT's policies can be summarized as making the cure worse than the virus itself.",It‚Äôs a completely valid opinion to think that restrictions go too far. The math won‚Äôt back you up.

"#47870 Any time I see someone posting about how excited they are about the vaccine, I can't help but to think they are just stupid and naive. And I resent them because I wish I could care. I got vaccinated months ago, and hear nothing but a stream of negativity - we don't know it will stop spread, keep wearing your mask, keep avoiding friends, mOsT DAnGeROUs TiME of the pandemic (@Rief), vulnerable people can't get it. Nothing changed. Nothing is getting better. It seems so useless. I wish I had just passed it up so some old person could get it and we could move on faster -- I just felt so much social pressure to get it at the first chance... but now? so hollow. so pointless. I really don't think things will ever be ok again and I think too many people would prefer it that way. The goalposts will always get moved and I won't get to have the things that bring me joy back. I don't even want parties or raves. I just want to use the locker room at the Z. I just want to go for a run without a mask. I just want to grab lunch with friends. I just want campus access back ( because a lot of grad students have remained barred from campus and nobody gives a shit ). All this new normal crap, why can't we at least pretend to care about the old normal. We don't have to be there now (and shouldn't be) but why isn't it worth aiming for?","Just about your entire list will be widespread in USA in July 2021. I initially thought Reif‚Äôs word-choice was hyperbole, but if you think spreading despair and YOLO right now is great strategy, then yeah this is probably the most dangerous time. Because lower rates for next ten weeks will save about 1,000,000 lives over next four years.","If you‚Äôre an undergrad living on campus, then the restrictions are really severe (likely for liability reasons). Boston has opened up its restaurants, there‚Äôs masked outdoor team sports going on as the weather is getting warmer, and kids are going back to in person school because we recognize the science behind how ineffective and horrible online school is for child development. I think you may just be in an MIT bubble, but things are getting better on the outside. Hang in there! Also, a lot of people took this year off with the intent to return to MIT. Let‚Äôs say next year is more of the same shit, consider taking it off and going somewhere the goal posts aren‚Äôt shifting as you put it.","Hi OP! I‚Äôm currently in Israel, where the majority of the population (including myself) got vaccinated. As a fact - there‚Äôs a drop in the number of sick people, no more isolated covid19 sections in hospitals, and we are slowly getting back to normal, with the opening of restaurants, bars, cinemas, clubs and even medium size weddings are now allowed!
Have hope, because I promise you that soon enough, all will be good ‚ù§Ô∏è","On the personal level, the vaccine makes you and everyone you interact with safe. Simple as that.
It wasn't quantified in the phase 3 trials, but by now plenty of evidence has accumulated that, as is nearly always the case, being vaccinated greatly reduces the maximal viral load you can get to, and your chances of transmitting to others.

I think that the gov't insistence on maintaining measures even after vaccination is a mistake - yeah, it has some truth to it, but if it makes people even 5% less likely to get vaccinated it does more harm than good. As someone who really harshly judged anyone at the height of the pandemic, I hereby grant you peer amnesty to go as back to normal as you can if you're vaccinated. You're not a bad person if you do that. You already did your part in keeping others safe.

(Yeah, there are variants out there that the Pfizer/
Moderna aren't 95% effective for, but even for them the vaccine goes to great lengths to protect you. And if new ones will come and stay, that'll just mean a new variant-specific shot every year, which I'll gladly take and call it victory)

On a more global level, I'd like to show you these three charts from a certain small country. On the right is number of new cases, middle is percent positive tests, left is number of people hospitalized. All dropped 2-6 times over the past month, while the country is lifting restriction after restriction and businesses are already full of unmasked people. Tomorrow people will celebrate Passover with their grandparents without fear. That's what you get with 50% vaccinated. We'll be there soon.

I know people have had bad experiences, but I‚Äôm only two appointments in and I feel so relieved already. Just being able to sit down and talk about my darkest demons, things I‚Äôve never talked to anyone ever before, has been such a great experience. If nothing else, getting things off your chest in a private setting is such a blessing."
"#47867 CW: suicide

One of the main reasons I hesitated to come to MIT wasn‚Äôt because of the workload. It wasn‚Äôt because of the location. It wasn‚Äôt because of the people.

It was because of the suicide rates.

Reading that MIT had the highest rate of suicide in the country was more than enough to wipe away the glisten of its prestigious research labs, its vigorous curriculum, its promise of a future career, its glamorous culture. Because none of that would matter if I was dead.

When I told people I was deciding between my state school and MIT, they would look at me surprised as if the choice was obvious. Then they would answer their own surprise, asking, ‚ÄúOh, is it the money?‚Äù I had no choice but to agree, hiding the more pressing matter of my own life.

I worried that if I told the truth, they would tell me that things had changed. After the string of suicides, MIT put more money into mental health! There‚Äôs more support for students now; look at S3, look at the therapists, look at all these resources! There have barely been any deaths!

But I wouldn‚Äôt have the heart to tell them that these were just bandaids for a gaping wound that would bleed through in a matter of seconds. Because it's clear nothing at this school stops, not even for death. Last week, 6 Asian women died from a mass shooting in ATL. The Asian community was in shambles. What did MIT do about that?

They gave out their glorified resources that are understaffed. They sent out an email, filled with empty consolation. They held a discussion for students to grieve that lasted an hour.

Do they expect us to be done with our grief in an hour?

The only professor of mine who acknowledged the event was my HASS professor. The rest continued sending emails on deadlines as if nothing had happened, as if the shooting was a fever dream. I wonder, are they even aware? Do they know the lives of six Asian women were extinguished? Do they know that there have been countless mass shootings in 2021 already? Do they know their students live in fear?

I have no choice but to work through my tears, because I know next week, I will have something new to grieve. I cannot push back my deadlines, because next week and the week after that might be worse. I know these emotions will cycle through. Every week, it‚Äôs a fight to survive and I know this institution doesn't care.

I‚Äôve had enough. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of this institution relying on their students to give each other support. I‚Äôm tired of MIT acting as if their resources are enough. These resources are there for a net. They are not where support for students start and end. Understand that students go to these resources when they are hanging on by a thread. There needs to be change upstream of that. Preventing deaths is the BARE MINIMUM.

I truly wonder, do admin know how much students are suffering? Not through a survey. I am sick of these damn surveys. Do you sit down and truly try to understand where our suffering comes from? Do you understand that we all have different pain, different struggles? Are you creating an environment where students are comfortable sharing? If not, you‚Äôre failing at the very first step. You cannot create a power dynamic, ignore our voices, and act as if it‚Äôs students faults that we have given up.

I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm writing this in anger. I focused on the recent mass shooting, but previous deaths have been treated the same.

You brought us back to school, so take responsibility. If there needs to be a change in the system, do it. Sticking band-aids on band-aids does nothing. The whole thing will just fall off. What‚Äôs happening right now is obviously not working. Anyone at this school can see that.","The push to address suicide has been around for at least half a century. Freshman pass-fail, debuting circa 1969, was one of those measures, trying to take some pressure off of straight-A students who suddenly found themselves barely breaking 50%.","can someone write an op ed about mit dealing with mental health? I've heard this point made so many times in different communities around campus, so I'm sure many students and staff at mit agree with your point, OP. As much help and support S3, SFS, and MIT Mental Health provide, these offices are very understaffed.
This problem existed before covid, but now that people dont naturally leave therapy, there is an even more apparent lack of professional mental health support.

Something needs to be done about it. I don't have the skills to write the article, but I would be happy to help in any way I can to advocate for better systems. feel free to dm me",Mahir,Yeah in hindsight I'm kind of glad I didn't get in because just personally I don't think I personally would have lived given some of the dark times I went through in college,Not to be mean but if you expect to have no assignments or deadlines everytime a tragic thing happens in the world then you should probably quit school cuz that shit happens every second

#47862 cw suicide if I tell medical that I have been having suicidal thoughts for a week now will they put me in the psych ward lmfao I don‚Äôt want to go there it just means I have to do everything all over again,"... i would not tell them about suicidal thoughts per se, especially if sharing those might indicate that you're in danger to yourself of others. I'd say something like ""i've been feeling worse than before"", or use other phrases that would describe your situation without doing into detail. You don't have to share everything with your therapist. Also, feel free to dm me if you want to talk, OP","Sorry, some of these other comments are really misleading, stigmatizing and a bit dangerous. You can absolutely tell a psychiatrist or psychologist at MIT medical that you are feeling suicidal!! It is their job to deal with suicidal people, they are trained for it, and theyre not going to punish you for being suicidal. Being suicidal is a sign that you are in immense pain, enough pain that ending your life sounds like a serious option and mental health professionals recognize that.

When you share with a doctor that you are suicidal, they go through a checklist that asks you if you have a plan, a method, and a date chosen. If you have any of those elements that you've given serious thought to, then the doctor may consider sending you to a psych ward. (They also might not, if you are suicidal, many doctors will walk you through your suicide prevention toolkit). But also, if you really are in a dark place where you have a plan to kill yourself, you may need to be getting more support than what you have right now. Nothing at MIT, or in your job, or whatever else in your life is stressing you out, is more important than your life. You deserve to feel better, and you should let medical know that things aren't going well right now so they can give you the help you need.

Feel free to dm if you want to talk, but please please please share that youve been feeling with way with someone, ideally MIT Medical but there are hotlines, textlines, or even emails (Good Samitaritans) that are all anonymous.",Then dont ever tell them that

My FWB is a phenomenal lover, but I can't ignore the truth. My first SO and I dated for long enough (and had enough sex) that all of our sexual habits were built around each other; because of that, no matter how good any of my future lovers are, they'll need to compete against the years of experience that my first SO had. I really like my new FWB and would like to really enjoy sex, but it's hard to let go of the constant comparisons I'm making in my head.

tldr: my first partner and I were each other's first everything. Because of that, our sex was primed for each other and I've never found anyone I like kissing/touching/fucking more because of how well they knew me. I want to stop comparing them to my current sexual partners, but I can't.

"#47845 This is a really embarrassing thing, but anyways. So I had broken up with my bf of 2 years last year in November, and I was really heart broken, cuz I thought we had a future, turns out that future was short lived. So I got really horny recently, and I hit up this guy, just to talk. So few days go by and things get hot and heavy between us. This was a 47 year old white man, had a wife and 2 kids, lived in US and had a fetish for asian women. Moreover, he had initiated sexual talks with me. He'd say things to me that turned me on and would lead me to fantasize about him for hours on end. I know it was horrible of me to do that, I even reminded him that he had a wife and 2 kids, but he didn't care. He just hated his life and wanted a change. I gave up, and gave in. I started sending him nudes and even racy videos. He'd do the same. He'd say that he loved me and that he wanted me to be his. Now, something struck in me, and I don't want anything to do with him.

"#47822 Not sure how to express this without invalidating the experiences of people who suppress their emotions due to environmental forces, especially at such a cutthroat place as MIT, but I really think we should normalize diverse levels of intensity of emotion. As someone with low levels of emotion across the board with extremely few exceptions, I'm tired of hearing people assume that I'm just suppressing emotion.

Low level of emotion does not necessarily imply no empathy and no conscience. Empathy consists of ""cognitive empathy,"" ""emotional empathy,"" and ""compassionate empathy,"" and only the second consists of sharing what others might be feeling. People can be compassionate and take care of others without really experiencing what others are feeling. People can push for compassionate policy changes at MIT without deeply feeling why others support the same policy.

Lots of emotions are ok. People should be empowered to share them and have people partake in joy and give support in hardship. Little to no emotion should also be ok.",it's also not a super good move to assume the level of emotion someone is feeling based on the amount of emotion they're showing anyway... so perhaps the move is just to Let People Be,Dragos Olaru cand ai scris postul asta?

"#47820 Hello MIT Confessions Community!

In CMS.791, a class on media theory, we are doing a digital ethnography project on MIT Confessions and have a short survey as a part of the project. The survey is anonymous and all the questions are optional. If you would like to be interviewed about your experience in the MIT Confessions community, there is a place in the survey to drop your email.

Anyone at all can take the survey as long as you are 18 or older. You do not need to be an MIT student to take the survey.

Survey link: https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cLUxZahXAO1Thhc

Thank you for your participation!",Yo your survey is a little ambiguous. I'm pretty sure all of your questions are specifically about MIT Confessions? But the last 2 or 3 questions just mention Facebook so at first I thought you were asking how often I read and react on FB overall. But when I realized there were no other questions I figured they all had to be specific to MIT Confessions. Not sure if anyone else will be confused by the wording.
#47819 what if we ü•∫ cuddled by the Charles üëâüëà and watched the sunset illuminate the windows of the buildings on the Boston skyline üåÉ
#47818 asking here bc idrk who to ask: can someone explain what the difference is btwn someone‚Äôs pronouns and their gender identity? i had always thought that pronouns were to indicate someone‚Äôs gender identity so that others didn‚Äôt assume it,"So pronouns are simply references that people use in place of your name for easy communication. E.g. it's hard to say: ""Sanjeev is a student at MIT. Sanjeev is failing Sanjeev's classes. Please send Sanjeev coffee so Sanjeev would feel better"". Pronouns allow you to make that easier so you say ""Sanjeev is a student at MIT. They're failing their classes. Please send them coffee so they feel better"". It's much easier and given that my pronoun choice is they/them, it's easier to communicate that without repeating my name like a gazillion times. But pronouns aren't only restricted to third-person, it's easier for everyone to have references in the first person. Like I'd say ""I'm an MIT Student. I'm failing all my classes. Please send me coffee so I feel better"". I'm using ""I/me"" pronouns as a placeholder for my name just as how someone would use ""they/them"" as a placeholder for my name. It's simply a grammatical tool.
I.e. Pronouns = grammar

On the other hand, gender identity is how you identify as in society's realm of gender expectations. So I identify as a Nonbinary demiguy because that's what I feel best describes where I fall on society's gender expectations. (You prob already know this <3)

Now there is the link of gendered pronouns which just refer to mainly third-person pronouns where someone else would reference a third party in speech (like the example I gave above). Gendered pronouns are simply grammatical, but have ties to one's identity. For example, I feel strongly against someone referring to me as ""he/him"" (for reasons I can't quite explain lol...) so I ask people to use ""they/
them"" in place of my name when referring to me. That's a gendered pronoun. However, someone else (and a lot of allies do this in support of the lgbtq community) can choose to use gender neutral pronouns in third-person speech because they don't feel the need to associate gender with whatever is being communicated. E.g. if I say, ""Do you know my friend Jessica? Yea, Jessica loves ice-cream"", there's no point in gendering the pronoun in the second sentence, so some people choose to go with: ""they love ice-cream""! Hypothetically, Jessica can be a woman and feel completely comfortable in her identity as a woman, but using ""they/
them"" doesn't affect anything in the communication there. And that's because, even though some pronouns are gendered, you don't need to gender someone in communication. So using gender neutral pronouns doesn't mean you're non-binary, using gender-opposite pronouns (like men using she/her or women using he/him) doesn't make you trans, or even using any pronouns doesn't make you the Avatar of genders; it simply just means, 'hey, use this arbitrary word to refer to me when you're using third-person speech because what you're saying has basically zero connection to gender"". It's purely a grammatical tool.
I.e. Communication ‚â† Gender (rather communication doesn't require gender)

So someone's use of pronouns isn't an indication of their gender identity. There are many cisgendered men/women who use ""they/them"" pronouns. Yes gender identity can (and a lot of times does) impact someone's choice of pronouns, but that isn't always the connection. [to get very nerdy, it's only a single implication arrow: Gender identity --(can influence)-> pronouns. But it doesn't work in the reverse: Pronouns --/(does not necessarily come from)-> gender identity]

Also, hmu if you wanna talk more about this... Please note I do not speak for all people with non-gendered pronouns and you should definitely get more perspectives from others about this!!!"

"#47812 I hurt my friend yesterday. And it really sucks because I only hurt her as a result of her helping me. She got me to be more open than I've ever been in my life. She allowed me to learn things about myself that I didn't know. Unfortunately, these were dark things and, being completely unprepared, I told her one of those things before I realized what was happening.

I intended no harm in saying what I said, but harm happened anyway. I did apologize, but it was in the heat of the moment, and I probably fucked that up somehow. I haven't heard from her since.

Now, I'm just hoping I didn't ruin our friendship. While I did not enjoy seeing the broken depths of my mind like that, I really needed to see them and I would not have done it if our friendship wasn't so strong.

I fucked up so hard and I can now only hope I didn't destroy a great thing that I share with a great person.","Feelings might be strong rn, but in time she'll (hopefully) forgive you. Just give it time :) Your friendship sounds great, and worth the effort to try and repair."

"#47787 How TF does everyone in college hang out with every other person? How do they know each other? I try to socialize as much as possible as a freshman first time on campus but somehow all my friendships and shallow asf and I barely know anyone. I‚Äôve done socializing but the most I got to is me knowing people exist and people knowing I exist and here people be going to fucking NYC road trips, doing random shit outside, enjoying in each other‚Äôs dorms and living the life. People say it‚Äôs covid but people are still having a ton of fun and I feel massive fomo everyday. Lol I barely know a few guys I say hi outside and zero girls and bros be hanging around and laughing with a group of 500 wtf is going on I‚Äôm goin to be a sophomore soon and why am I not a normal person I‚Äôm so tired of talking to course 6 sellouts like me when will I be normal",Let's start our sophomore year freshly as we are frosh next year and not worry now ü§†,gee i don‚Äôt remember writing this confession ü§î,Go greek? >>,Charles PhuJavier Solis this is real
"#47786 I‚Äôm confident in my abilities and i know that i can achieve the goals i have set for myself. However, image based sexual abuse or revenge porn is a tough bitch to handle, i was a victim back when i was 14 and yet I‚Äôm still affected by it many years later. Im constantly scared of achieving something great in the future because i feel like it‚Äôs gonna resurface again and people will once again relentlessly mock me again for it. How do i deal with this? I dont really feel comfortable talking to a therapist about it because i still have that sense of shame lingering within me, constantly stuck between feeling like i deserve what happened to me and that i shouldnt bother getting help for it, and that it would be silly to press charges against those who did this to me.","a reminder--there
is literally no way EVER that you deserved for that to happen to you. and you are more than entitled to ask for help--you won't be burdening anybody, because it's literally a therapist's job to help people who have been through trauma. i know the emotional part of your brain doesn't always listen to the rational part, but at least (hopefully) the rational part can remember that it wasn't your fault and that you deserve to feel better.","So two things.

First, never feel guilty, shame or bad about what happened. You are the victim here and you did nothing wrong.

This is no different than I‚Äôd some random person T-boned you while driving and you need to talk to a therapist about it.

Second, this part is going to be unpopular, but then that shame into motivation. Get as much wealth and power as you can and use that to destroy the perpetrator. Destroy their careers, their business and their lives. This is not for personal revenge. This is to make an example out of someone to help prevent future victims. If people see posting revenge porn gets them destroyed, they might think again before doing it.","Hey, I don‚Äôt have a great answer but just a reminder that revenge porn is illegal in most states and child porn is definetly illegal in all states. When you‚Äôre hugely successful, in the worst case if those people release something, you can tell them to fuck off and hopefully get them thrown in jail/ ruin their lives. Please press charges, perhaps with the support of friends close to you, whatever happened I can promise you it wasn‚Äôt your fault.",You were literally a child when it happened to you OP. I'm so sorry. It wasn't your fault.,"OP, I've been a victim of revenge porn and I still am affected a couple of years later.","If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone by voice, maybe you can try the RAINN chatline?

"#47785 Its super dirty for a class to put things like ""Limited to 20 words"" on a test for explanation questions, and then nitpick your answers. Like, either ask more direct questions rather than open-ended explanations or be a little more generous for answers.","Do they actually penalize for going a bit over the word count? When I was TA-ing a class, short answer questions were sometimes so hard to grade because people would literally write essays when they didn't know the answer hoping to somehow accidentally write a key phrase or something in their third paragraph","Most questions with these limits have very succinct answers, no? The whole point is to tell you that you can answer the question quickly if you know it. No one wants to wade through a dissertation for a 5 word answer :p"
#47784 not having spring break means my midsemester spiral is affecting my semester and is larger than usual
"#47783 I get that covid sucks and everything, but I really thing people should be trying to make the most out of the situation. Take it a bit easier on classes, don't stress over grades (consider putting your hardest class on PE/NE, drop a class if needed, etc.), and try to have fun. Go outside and enjoy the nice spring weather, meet new people (in a socially distanced way), step outside your comfort zone and try something new. Try extra hard to enjoy yourself this semester. Do you really want to look back on your college years, 10, 20, or 30+ years down the line, and just remember staying inside, locked up in your room, doing psets and crying all day? We are getting years taken away from what should be one of the most fun experiences in life, which really sucks, but instead of letting it put you down, do what you can to make the most of it.","Thank you for this OP, really appreciate it :)",Ashhad Alam is this is a sign from god that i should drop a class üò≥,Ebad Ur Rehman this post is written by Khanzada Ashhad Aly Khan
#47782 i wish classes weren't allowed to have assignments due for a week which would've actually relieved stress rather than have two days off full of work -- literally have the same amount of work just now expected to do everything over the break. for one class they still expect us to watch both recorded lectures this week fml
#47781 Can anyone talk about their experience being admitted to a psychiatric hospital during the semester? I‚Äôd send myself there right now if it weren‚Äôt for the pressure to stay afloat in classes,"This is quite embarrassing, but I've actually been admitted there 4 times now, lol (luckily, one of those times was during the summer). So feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Most recently, I was admitted involuntarily because I really didn't want to go for academic reasons. I was already in my senior spring and didn't want to mess up my graduation plans. But MIT mental health didn't think it was safe for me to not be in a hospital, so I was forced to go. Ultimately, this was a good thing because un-aliving myself would've messed up my graduation plans anyways (and a lot of other things too).

Classes don't matter if you are so ill that you might cause fatal harm to yourself. You should talk to a clinician at MIT mental health. Just be honest. If they think you should go to the hospital, they will make you go. S3 will help you afterwards. Good luck!","It's nice being in a hospital setting where you have so many social workers to talk to and you feel safe there. It made me feel much happier afterwards ... I stayed there for 4 weeks this semester and there's nothing wrong with taking less classes to take care of yourself, that's totally understandable.
You have a condition that should be taken care of, your mental health comes first <3 MIT does coordinate strongly with Mclean, so you're always supported after your stay. I stayed for a while because I was severely depressed and suicidal, but I was never on medication and didn't think counseling was helping before.","I was admitted to MGH and ended up doing Inpatient at McLean last semester. MIT was very understanding and cooperative with me in this time. S^3 and the CARE team were very helpful and got two exams and six weeks of Psets excused for me. I was able to do 4 weeks of outpatient without constantly feeling stressed about classes. I did have to shave my schedule down to 3 classes, but I wasn‚Äôt managing my health before so it was necessary with or without therapy. Basically, if you feel like you should, do it. MIT will help you figure out the details after.","In fall 2019, I was admitted to MGH and was an inpatient at McLean for two weeks. It was a pretty good experience, actually - I found everyone there, patients and MHS's (Mental Health Specialists) alike, extremely supportive. It was such a relief to be able to focus solely on my mental and physical well-being and not have to worry about the tons of classwork and extracurricular
s that were overwhelming me. And afterwards, S^3 was extremely helpful with talking to my profs and making sure that I wasn't penalized for the work that I missed.

With regards to the hospital inpatient experience, if you can get a bed at McLean, it's actually a really good experience. McLean is known as one of the best psychiatric hospitals in the nation for a reason. You'll still have your phone, laptop, etc., so you won't be cut off from the outside world. The MHS's are wonderful people who actually care about you, and my fellow patients were lovely. The group therapy sessions are not mandatory, but I would strongly recommend going to as many as you can - I certainly found them very helpful.

I'd recommend talking to someone at MIT Mental Health and being honest about how you're feeling. There should be no shame in having a mental illness, and no shame in getting hospitalized for that, just like there's no shame in getting hospitalized for any other life-threatenin
g condition. Sometimes life just gets extremely overwhelming and you need to be able to take a break and focus on your mental health.

Please focus on your health, OP - classes are way less important than you staying alive and healthy. And please feel free to DM me if you want to talk! I'm here to listen. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

That means you‚Äôre just as qualified as everyone else and are going to do great.

I love my time at MIT. it was certainly stressful and probably the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done but I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world.","Honestly, that kind of feeling will stick with you beyond mit and in life in general. That feeling you have is something you will have to learn to face wherever you are. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm working on even as a postdoc so don‚Äôt let that scare you/prevent you from enjoying MIT. Don‚Äôt let your mind go there.","My experience was that students banded together to do the work. So it was HARD, but not competitive at all. May just have been my experience, but at least shows you can find a non-competitive
environment at the 'Tute if you want. Congratulations
!!","I felt like the MIT applicant culture -- and to a lesser extent, the admitted student culture -- was way more explicitly competitive than the actual MIT culture. As an MIT student, I knew I was surrounded by people who've done national and international academic competitions, and I've never met anyone who'd participated in those competitions (or even really heard of them) before I applied to MIT and started talking on college admissions forums. Once I actually got to MIT, I found most people to be really down-to-earth, regardless of whatever amazing achievements they have under their belt, academic or otherwise. So definitely give it a chance before you assume what the culture there will be like! The pre-MIT culture was, for me, an extension of being an overachieving high schooler who was fueled by the competitive desire to get to a school like MIT -- once I got there, it was completely different.","Give serious consideration to a year off, if it's an option for you.

Also, when you do start, don't go overboard Freshman year.

"#47774 Is it wrong that I find cis people who introduce themselves with their pronouns kind of cringe? If you‚Äôre trans or non-binary and want me to use a pronoun different from what I would naturally assume based on your appearance, then please tell me your pronouns and I‚Äôll be happy to use them. But like... for the other 90% of the population, it just comes off as trying too hard to look woke. I feel the same way when I see white people with #BLM in their profiles. It‚Äôs less about actually supporting a cause than it is signaling to people that you‚Äôre part of the woke college elite who understands gender studies and critical race theory. Why don‚Äôt we just try just being nice to one another instead of flexing how progressive we are?",I think most people do it to normalize the practice. Some trans and non-binary people have made calls for more people to share pronouns so that they don't feel as singled-out or awkward when they do it.,"I‚Äôm cis but bi, and I feel the urge to state my pronouns sometimes not only to normalize it, but to reinforce what kind of friends I want to surround myself with","I mean, it is signaling, mostly to people with nonstandard pronouns that they can ask me to use them, and it will be no big deal.
Also, I imagine it's very stressful for binary trans people to have to always ask themselves ""Am I passing enough today that's they will naturally use my preferred pronoun, or do I have to ask? Am I outing myself if I do?"". It's probably easier if it's just a thing everyone does all the time.","Everything about this is wrong. You state your pronouns because you accept that no one should infer your gender identity based on your appearance. And when you do so, you are sending a message to all the non binary folks around you that they will be respected by you. For more info: ""MyPronouns.org Resources on Personal Pronouns"" https://
www.mypronouns.o
rg/","since when is saying ""black lives matter"" critical race theory? it's pretty easy to understand my guy","I mean part of it is normalizing things like asking for and giving pronouns enough that it's not only the people whose pronouns don't match their birth assignment who are doing it, that way nonbinary and gnc people don't have to call a ton of attention to themselves to be gendered correctly.",I disagree that you have to have a particular skin color to support BLM.,"Oof this is very cringe on multiple levels. I'm seeing a lot of good input in comments already, but I highly recommend actually engaging in conversation about *why* this bothers you, and the assumptions this statement has (that being cis is the norm, that having different pronouns from what you might expect is ""other""). The comments above aren't by any means groundbreaking knowledge and probably are easily found on your own if you talk to anyone who puts pronouns after their name (regardless of gender identification)
, so it's concerning the lack of understanding this post has. While you definitely want action beyond just social media posts, and to not get complacent just because you're normalizing pronouns, villainizing those who do is sort of counterproducti
ve.

Responding to allies with, ""why can't we just be nice"" is tone-deaf. Ask the bigots that. They're why we ""can't just be nice.""","im an actual trans person and I do find it super uncomfortable when ppl ask me my pronouns when I know they don‚Äôt do that for everyone, it feels like a reminder that I‚Äôm a Strange Gender Weirdo.","Putting your pronouns in your bio/
introducing yourself with your pronouns if you're cis normalizes it and also distracts attention from those who do so because they identify differently than the way they might appear. If everyone's doing it, it's harder to be able to point out the ""other."" I love when cis people use their pronouns in introductions because then I don't feel as unsafe sharing that I like using they/them",like the comment above says it‚Äôs to normalize practices so when you do introduce yourself with pronouns it‚Äôs not a huge target on your back that you‚Äôre lgbt...plus pronouns ‚â† gender so it‚Äôs really helpful to share what you prefer and what makes you comfy.,ok so should I just go back to assuming everyone's pronoun based on their appearance? what's the move woke boss?,The whole point is to normalize it.,introducing urself w ur pronouns is a nice thing! ur normalizing pronouns being a part of the conversation :]] also pronouns ‚â† gender,"Hi I am trans and you are wrong. Thanks and goodbye.

Also, Black lives matter. That isn't a performance, that's a fact.","I am assuming you are cisgender, so sorry if you are not. But shouldn‚Äôt you ask trans people what they would prefer instead of feeling all bothered what you think is correct. Pronouns should never be forced, but they should be encouraged, especially for cis people. Have you thought that some trans people do not want to be singled out when presenting themselves? If all cisgender people shared their pronouns then it would normal for trans people to share their pronouns whether they are non-common pronouns or not. I would encourage you to read more about what trans people have to say online to better understand how to help us. I understand the feeling that using BLM or presenting with pronouns can be performative, but that does not mean that we should not do it. It is more that people should not stop there. There are more pressing issues for us like not getting killed, getting better healthcare and having more protections at work and schools. But it should not be the your job to decide what is enough and what is not if you are cisgender.",Okay?,"also like...why do you assume you can tell when someone is cis when they‚Äôre giving you their pronouns? do you assume that you can ‚Äúspot‚Äù a trans person and know immediately whether they‚Äôre trans or just a ‚Äúcis person flexing how progressive they are‚Äù?

a lot of the other comments here are doing a wonderful job at expressing why it‚Äôs so important to normalize pronouns, but it also fundamentally comes down to the fact that the whole point of giving pronouns is that you shouldn‚Äôt assume how someone identifies based on their appearance. that goes in all directions. pronouns aren‚Äôt just for people who you think don‚Äôt pass...","On a pragmatic level, I'm a super masculine cis/
het male with impressive educational and professional credentials. I'm in that weird place where despite being nerdy and super eccentric and flouting most professional social conventions, people actively invite me to seats of power literally anywhere I go. Like, I'm welcome in almost any space I take up in a professional setting. Meeting with the team, meeting with the CEO, meeting with clients, meetings with colleagues, professional panels and conferences and assemblies, etc. I'm enthusiastically pulled into those spaces all the time. And as dumb as it sounds, having a pride flag at my desk or a nonbinary flag sticker on my laptop means they have to pull that into the meeting, too. They have to stare at it while we talk. And they have to deal with not knowing whether it applies to me, and they have to feel the space that that uncertainty might take up.

And like, it's my very sincere hope that someone who is not cishetmale sees the flag and recognizes it as an invitation to take up that space. I am a Very Important Person in my profession, and if anyone sees that flag I hope it gives them the inclination and the courage to walk into my space and chat. I want them to have access to the social and professional capital that comes with getting to talk to me. I want to give them that social shortcut. If I'm at a panel and I pull out my chromebook and someone sees the NB flag on it, I very much want them to feel like they can come up to me, we can talk, I can introduce them to my colleagues or other associates, etc. Like, I'm making that space specifically so someone who doesn't normally have it can take it up. I didn't anticipate how many people would actually take the opportunity until I did it.

And like, on a personal level, both my spouse and my best friend are queer and NB and, to be completely honest, I fucking refuse to occupy any space that wouldn't enthusiasticall
y have them in it, too. Even if it means I have to bring that space myself.","Why not call it what it really is? Mental illness. For over 2,000 years theres only been two genders based on genitalia. Stop confusing everyone with your mental illness."

"#47767 I think waiting until marriage for sex is objectively wrong.

People used to get married at like 17, so it was easy to wait.

Now, not so easy. The thing about waiting is that you should know exactly what you age getting into when you get married. Not having sex before, even once, runs the risk that the marriage falls apart for whatever reason.

That being said, I haven‚Äôt even been in a relationship so flame me if I‚Äôm wrong.","Completely agree!
In non-western countries, young people now have to wait -at least- till their mid-30s and early 40s (if not more than that) to get married (to be financially capable, like buying an apartment, and paying for ridiculously expensive engagement and wedding sh!t)
And ironically speaking, they have the highest divorce rates world-wide!!
And I‚Äôm not just talking about sex, just relationships in general like finding someone and falling in love (because they expect marriage if you do that, which is a career crippling choice at that stage!)
which is kinda pathetic and sad!
So in my opinion, the western model is far more practical and humane","Since when did we equate things being difficult with them being wrong lol...

And if your marriage is going to fall apart because of sexual (in)experience or you're unable to work through sexual (in)compatibili
ty, you've got more problems than just sex. Relationships inherently take working through difficulties together, which you'll find out if you ever get into a healthy one.","It's not wrong, but it's illogical. You can't be expected to keep up with the times in one sense (waiting to get married) but not in another (delaying sex until marriage).","Just because something is difficult to do, doesn't mean it's wrong! And I also don't think sex is the way to find out if you're compatible with someone-- if anything, sex is the easy part of a relationship and I think it would be way scarier to get attached to someone because you're used to being so intimate physically, and then get old and find that you actually have nothing in common.",I wouldn't catalogue it as 'wrong'.

#47762 My friends think Im stupid because I squat the right way. they claim 90 degrees is the best but i think ass to grass is optimal. They also think knees over toes is unsafe but there are numerous sources that show that kenss over toes helps you fix knee problems. Please comment if you agree or disagree. #ATG for life. stop looking like baby in the gym.,crease between thigh and hip at or below knee is good enough for powerlifting comps so it's good enough for me. just don't quarter squat <3,"as long as you're below parallel, you're fine--just don't do knee bobs and call it a squat. the danger with knees past toes is shifting your weight too far forward and the resulting pitch forward, potential bar rolling up to your neck. plus, the weight is more stable when it's in your foot, esp heels, than in your toes (and, can make toes hurt). also, some of us can't go that deep because our calf and hamstring muscles get in the way. i'm assuming this is either unweighted or low weight, but good luck with that, i guess","Qualification:
I got into MIT with an video essay featuring me squatting 315x5

Answer:
To squat ATG, I assuming you are doing high bar (which I do too). It‚Äôs all about being flexible in your hips and being able to push your thighs/knees outwards. I find yoga really helpful for that.

To help, also do lighter pause squats and stay at the bottom.

"#47760 Doesn‚Äôt the perception of MIT feel a extremely masculinized? Whenever I post a confession, people assume I‚Äôm a guy/dude. In the post, I would only ever write about inherently nongendered topics, like ML or complaining about psets or code or whatever I have going on. I think when people are told someone attends this school, they tend to immediately assume that it‚Äôs a male. Institutionally, this school was male dominated for the longest time. How does this reflect on the hidden history of women in technology? Well, digital humanities reminds us that female or non male folks have historically made great contributions to technology (think NASA), but have often been uncredited. This current culture feels like a reflection of this past. Women are again somehow‚Äîthough not explicitly; only implicitly‚Äîforgotten. I wish that the culture was flipped. I wish that when people read confessions here in which someone complains about code or talks about whatever nerdy shit they want to talk about, they‚Äôd recognize that it could fully be a female poster. I wish that when you hear about that new technological advance that I contributed to, you would assume that I could be woman. Imagine an MIT where people would immediately assume that you are female. The thought is radical. But somehow it doesn‚Äôt feel radical when we imagine an MIT in which everyone outside assumes you are male. This is culturally ingrained misogyny.",I've come across people who identify as feminist and just assume MIT undergrads are mostly male (which fits into their self-perceived feminism). This post explains really well the underlying sexism behind that thinking.,"If the gender ratio is 50:50, there's no reason for a majority of even MIT students to automatically assume that a post was written by a woman instead of a man. Then, add in the general heuristics we've developed based on the broader population (see Ben's numbers above, for example), and it makes sense that we should associate such posts with men.
As an analogy, given that 91% of nurses nationwide are female, if School X's nursing program has a 50:50 gender ratio, or even 70:30 male:female ratio, most people would still assume that a person posting a nursing-related
confession is a woman. Just because people follow their heuristics or don't look up your particular statistic doesn't mean they're misogynists.",An older female graduate reported that they didn't even have women's bathrooms on campus until the 70s because there were so few professors or studentsüòï,people are always so surprised when i tell them the gender ratio is 50:50,Preach,ÿπÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∑ÿ®ÿÆ,üôå,Afeefah Khazi-Syed ‚Äúyou got in cuz you‚Äôre a woman‚Äùüòí,Hmmüò•,"(edit: this is pointed at the assumptions of non-MIT people) 88% of ML researchers are male, and also attached pic is CS in general. ofc that's not the case at MIT, but in general the chances the guess is correct are almost 90% - a reasonable threshold for a heuristic like that imo

it also probably doesn't help that only 16% of MIT's faculty are women. people ""assume"" because their assumptions are reflective of reality","http://

Any tips from people who have been in this situation before?","Is it necessary to leave mit having your first kiss ? If you think so , then please let it be special
Don't worry about your inexperience , you know those times when you want to talk to your mom to explain to her something and still couldn't make her understand then you wish you could yell with everything you are having in your mind in a fast way ?
Just let your feelings free , go to the man you liked , forget about the conditions , forget about what other says , forget about everything , it's just a girl telling a man that she likes him , nothing special about that !
Take a deep breath , and just tell yourself , 30 seconds of courage , that's all it takes , 30 seconds of crazy courage and then you can do whatever you want , just let yourself have that 30 seconds and tell him ,
As exemple "" come on jack ! 30 seconds of courage ! Come on man ! Just 30 seconds !!!! "" In that 30 second , go to the one you like and talk to him

I felt lonely and sad back then when I was single and doing a PhD.

"#47745 I feel like such a loser. Nobody in my pod will eat lunch or dinner with me unless there's someone else already there with me (whether they had pity on me or needed homework help, I don't know). Same with studying, if I'm talking with someone else from my pod you'll see other people from my pod decide it's a good time to hang out; otherwise, I'm just doing stuff alone even though they *all* know that I'm working in a public space hoping someone would join me.

And when I'm couped up in my room? Oh no, there's always pod stuff going on then.

I've always had insecurities about myself, and figured that maybe when I'm in college I'll actually find people who genuinely care about *me*. Turns out even my podmates hate me and will only hang out with me if the cooler person in the pod is with me, and that's probably because their desire to hang out with that other person outweighs their disgust toward me.

Say what you will about the power of collaboration, but as far as personal life goes I'm going to try my absolute best to rely on no one. I don't care what any of you will say in the comments section because if I'm being frank, literally everyone who isn't me is either a whole lot less awkward or so much more beautiful that others consider you to be worth their time. I have no such qualities, so the less I can make myself care about what others think about me, the better I'll feel about myself.","My heart is breaking for everyone in your position, OP. I wish I had helpful advice, but all I can say is that you‚Äôre definitely not the only one experiencing this. It took me 2-3 years at MIT to really figure out a social scene and make friends who I clicked with (I was also awkward in high school and before that), and if I was attending during COVID, I 100% would not have succeeded in doing that at all. The idea of having to form ‚Äúpods‚Äù when I didn‚Äôt even know anyone, or when my friends were closer to each other than to me... it‚Äôs scary and intense. I really hope you can experience a more normal MIT soon because honestly, there‚Äôs no better place to be awkward and figuring things out socially ‚Äî a lot of other people are doing the same thing, or would be if they could leave their rooms. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, OP, it sounds shitty. üòû","There are far too many people who exist in this world for you to claim you'll rely on nobody after meeting like a few. + the fact that you say literally everybody who isn't you is less awkward/more beautiful makes me think you've been living under a rock LOL.

But your last sentiment's a whole mood, even if you end up changing your mind about relying on nobody. Who cares whether you're worth someone's time or not? Just occupy it anyway. Force people to look at you. Or being a wallflower isn't so bad as everybody thinks it is.

That being said, if your pod really doesn't care about you as you think, they probably don't hate you or feel disgusted by you. It takes a lot of effort to actively hate someone, and going by the other side of your logic, they shouldn't really care enough about you to hate you. I used to think I was a nuisance to everybody/that they all hated me, and then a friend once told me ""bro they literally couldn't give a flying fuck about you"" and that made me feel better.","Hey OP, do you want someone to vent to, my dm‚Äôs are open","Hey OP, I'm sorry that you are going through this. I have a few thoughts for you.

First is that even if this situation sucks, this is an opportunity for you to face adversity and grow. I'm assuming that this may be the first time you are away from home and your loved ones, but, regardless, this might not be the last time that you are faced with such adversity. I think that you're going through the worst kind of loneliness which is that in which you are surrounded by people, and so that you can't even enjoy your own solitude. Try to claim your own space, privacy and make it your temple. Self-reliance? 10/10 skill to have.

I think it is a positive thing that you have realized that your podmates have no regard for you. The social contract goes both ways, and you don't need to pour your time and energy into them either. It's best if you shift your focus to activities that you care about, give self-care the importance it deserves. I've seen successful cases of people getting over their social awkwardness, and I think the best thing you can do is investing in yourself. Aim to become a better version of yourself, aim to be someone you like. Do it for yourself, and not for anyone else. The rest will follow.

Take care OP. Good luck!"

He‚Äôd be frustrated that my mental health was still suffering, even though I was seeing a psychiatrist and mental health is a cyclical thing. It was always a session of shaming me for not getting better and trying to convince me that really I didn‚Äôt need academic help, even though shuffling a few due dates around could seriously rescue my mental and physical health. Not to mention the impossibility of getting an appointment or the wait in walk-in hours being a serious burden to even seeing someone.
I just email the TA directly. This has worked in every single class besides GIRs which are more insistent on S3 support. I‚Äôve always gotten the extra time I‚Äôve needed and they always are so ready to offer any kind of additional accommodations I need.","As a suggestion, in case you run into issues with professors/TAs in the future, the disability office might be the more correct resource for your specific needs?"
#47734 Is it weird to want to wait till marriage to have sex,"Highly sensible and commendable. When limited to marriage, the oxytocin released in sexual activity helps to deepen the emotional bond between husband and wife. With pre-marital sex, that same pathway makes it harder to think clearly about whether your sexual partner is a wise choice as a lifelong spouse. The habits of self-control gained in pre-marital chastity will help you stay faithful in marriage, while the instincts developed in pursuit of casual sex are hard to unlearn when you're ready to devote yourself to one person.",It was a method for not having babies outside marriages and too young mothers,Jokes on me.

"#47723 I'm really confused about my sexuality and would appreciate any input from those with similar experiences. I've always dated men but have been fascinated by women. I remember being really intrigued/interested by certain celebrities like Kristen Stewart (even before she came out and was in Twilight), King Princess, Miley Cyrus, and other female icons that are common celebrity crushes for bi/gay women. And I remember that when I first started exploring sexuality, I always used images of women and not men. And penises used to honestly frighten me, but nude women would excite me.

My main source of confusion though is I've read about straight women also using lesbian porn or naked women for material during masturbation. I can't really imagine myself doing anything sexual with a woman, but I also used to be repulsed by penises until I grew comfortable with them through exploration with boyfriends, so I guess it could also be something that would be overcome with experience.

I guess I'm not sure if I'm actually bisexual or if it's just symptomatic of the over-sexualization of women in modern society/the media. Anyone have thoughts/experience with this?",I literally could not recommend Women Don't Owe You Pretty by Florence Given enough. The author goes into a lot of the same things that you mentioned here and I think it may be helpful,"I actually had a pretty similar experience growing up and discovering my sexuality! I considered myself straight due to compulsive heterosexuality
when I was younger despite finding women attractive and looking at pornographic images of women, because I figured I ""had"" to be straight, that there was some weird thing that made people non-straight. It was a long journey, but after a lot of soul-searching and self-acceptance
work I finally came to terms with being bisexual, something I continue to identify as today.

Point is, the journey of discovery can be a really complicated one! It's so easy to have internalized homophobia and think that you can't be queer due to ""something"", and it's also totally common to find women pretty without being romantically attracted to them! If you're not ready to identify with a particular label or state ""I know what my sexuality is"", that is so totally okay! Even if other people seem like they've ""got it all figured out"", everyone moves at different paces.","i just want to say that last line you wrote, that you‚Äôre not sure if it‚Äôs your attraction to women or the oversexualizati
on of women in society‚Äîit is SUCH a common thought for gay women.

yes, women are oversexualized.
does that mean that you‚Äôre not attracted to them anyway? nope. for myself, i found that i was in fact suuuper uncomfortable seeing the way women are depicted in media and for a long time thought that the discomfort i felt meant that i wasn‚Äôt gay. honestly, it took me being around other queer folks to realize that I was gay and that attraction (or lack of) feels different for everyone.

there is no easy way to find out if you *actually* bi or not. and in fact that‚Äôs not something you really CAN find out. there‚Äôs not really a checklist of experiences that define what it means to be attracted to someone! it‚Äôs sometimes counterproducti
ve to try to define sexuality so rigorously

all that being said, there really isn‚Äôt anything you can do to tell. it‚Äôs never a bad idea to try to read up more about queer theory (i suggest looking at comp het! it‚Äôs super pervasive and a huge reason why many queer folks don‚Äôt figure out they‚Äôre gay until later in life). but in general, just do your thing and talk to some people who‚Äôve gone through the same!!

#47722 How do you at talk in interviews? I feel like I‚Äôm either too stiff or too casual and end up freaking out and messing them up :(,"Beyond what Wilson said, if the interviewer is good and experienced (and not just ""let's have a chat and see what my impression is"") they've probably seen all manner of interview-induc
ed behavior and are skilled at extracting exactly what they need despite that (e.g. looking for corroboration of traits listed on the cv).
So once you do everything that can help you in advance, like Wilson said, at the interview itself you can (if it helps you relax) just trust your interviewer, and think of your behavior as ""helping them do their job"" rather than ""making or breaking a fragile impression of you"".

Also, I'm both too stiff *and* too casual at interviews :)","Interviewing is a skill and takes practice.

You need to TIME your answers. They should be between 75-90s. Any longer and people get bored.

challenge -> solution -> impact/good outcome -> and this is why you are a good fit for the role

"#47718 You know, something that's always bothered me is how toxic anime fans can be to the so called ""useless female anime characters,"" such as Sakura. Like yes of course you can criticize a character, but I've seen way too many posts on online forums where people are so vicious and livid to the point where it's that fine line where I'm not sure if they're just insulting this anime girl or all women in general. Like are you hating on this anime girl or do you just hate women? It's like they're taking out their real life frustrations out on these female characters, and it just rubs me off as extremely misogynistic.
Besides that point, I find it so weird how these fans don't look at the authors/creators of these manga/anime and criticize them for not being able to write strong female characters. It's like a vicious circle where the creator has horrible misconceptions about women, writes a horrible female character that infuriates fans, and then these fans are inspired to create their own manga/anime where the also write bad female characters. Again, if Sakura is so ""useless"" (which she's not as she's shown several times), maybe blame Kishimoto for not writing her properly.
I just think that fans, especially male fans, need to stop bashing so much on women.","Sakura was actually super mean and lacking in combat skill in the beginning though...

I generally agree with this post but we could've found a diff character","Penny Brant Sirena Yu Jocelin Su huge shoutout to Hajime Isayama for writing some of the best female anime characters like Mikasa(superhum
an strength), Annie (incredible combat skill), Pieck(incredibl
e intelligence), Historia(kindes

Sure making someone more alive is a good thing but not the only thing female characters should be doing","This is a good point and I will die on this hill. Do they realize when the very female characters they complain about are created by and designed to cater to....the male
gaze? Maybe you don‚Äôt want it, sure, but try take it to the ‚Äúnext hop‚Äù sometimes. It means enough people wanted this and so the anime industry will keep churning out anime women, or worse, weak, ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and oversexualzed girl-children designed without any input from women. Therefore if the fans are not actively critiquing and dismantling the idea we need such ‚Äúfan service,‚Äù the annoying, bitchy, mean, inconsistent and confusing AF female characters that seemingly have no relevance to the story besides being the literal and metaphorical punching bags, bottom of some jokes, are exactly the price you pay for not speaking up about it‚Äîbut if it‚Äôs your choice not to speak up, then this is exactly what you get.",this is a pervasive problem with shounen anime/manga unfortunately ://,"Unfortunately, we have xkcd/385 for anime characters.",BnHA is a bad manga/anime for this reason change my mind,"When someone says x is a bad character, isn‚Äôt it implicit that the author wrote them poorly?

roles outside of what the creators gave them? I don‚Äôt get the point ? Anyway, I guess it really depends how people talk about them; I watch anime but don‚Äôt read forums so I don‚Äôt know. But when I say Sakura is a terrible character (which she objectively is) it‚Äôs not because I hate women, it‚Äôs because she is poorly written. Also, I agree most shounen suffers from weak female characters--pro
bably because they are written by men, and it is harder for them to write female characters? or they aren't bothered? Ultimately it is the author's story, and they choose how to tell it, and who to focus on. ‰ªïÊßò„Åå„Å™„ÅÑ","Amy Lei Sexism is def rampant and is hella wrong, but Sakura deserves to be bashed cuz she's just not as good as Tsunade üò≥",Sakura insulted an orphan in front of the only other orphan...

If we are talking about Naruto, where Sakura is a character in, there are as many strong, badass female characters as there are trash ones like Sakura and Tenten. Same goes for male characters like Inojin and Choji being trash in the beginning while the MCs were strong af. Other famous shonen anime, Fairy Tale? Look at Erza. Anyways, I don‚Äôt wanna bother with any more examples but I do get your point. Some take it way too far by literally assuming that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs trash cause she‚Äôs a girl‚Äù which ofc is problematic.

"#47712 S3 should be more responsive to students' needs and shouldn't make it so difficult to ask for help. They make it unnecessarily difficult to get an extension on anything and are dismissive of our concerns. MIT students are already hardworking and doing the best they can in their classes. When we ask for help we truly need it, and when you go to S3 it feels like they are actively trying to discredit our situation as though we are merely trying to get an extension because we are lazy and don't want to do our work on time, when in reality we reach out because we care about our education and value maintaining the quality of our work. Furthermore, most professors are so averse to granting extensions unless S3 supports the action, that even when you reach out directly to the professor you feel invalidated because unless S3 has okay'ed it, they simply cannot decide for themselves whether or not a cause is legitimate. However, S3 has created such an unwelcoming space, that reaching out to them in the first place feels intimidating and pointless. In short, IHTFP <333"
"#47711 I've really enjoyed the lectures in 18.06 so far and all things considered I think the professor is really good at communicating the concepts. But at the same time, I can't help but feel as though he is being overly rigid with the class structure. He comes off as hostile to every suggestion about modifying the course and seems to have given little to no wiggle room despite the circumstances."
"#47710 How to talk to S3:
Get into the root of your situation. You have a million psets and exams and papers due this week? Don't just say that, talk about how that's out of the ordinary. Talk about the physical ramifications the stress has had on you. Have you gotten headaches? Nosebleeds? Insomnia? Don't have time to sleep yet can't sleep when you do because of anxiety?

Request a specific counselor. Ask your friends if they've worked with anyone really nice at S3. Counselors are people too, and they're exposed to a constant stream of students at their absolute lowest every day. Some counselors handle it better, others will gradually shift their reference frame over time and get completely desensitized to regular MIT suffering.

Bring up any ""ambient"" stress that you're comfortable sharing. Most people can handle busy weeks just fine in a vaccum. But if you have medical problems, family problems, money problems, etc the psets will push you over the edge. S3 knows this. But when you're immersed in this extra stress every day, you often forget it's even there, leeching away at your life force.

Show up with a clear idea of what you need. S3 exists to evaluate and implement your requests, not really to brainstorm strategies for your problems (unfortunate, but true).

And remember, the folks at S3 have minimal impact on your future. You can talk to them about shit you shouldn't talk about with your professors, because S3 is swimming in despair every day and they won't be writing you rec letters or giving you grades ever. Their greatest purpose is to exist as an insulating layer between students and instructors - professors and TAs generally don't want to hear about personal info that might affect their judgement of you as a person and a student. S3 support exists so you can talk to a 3rd party about your personal problems, instead of your professor who doesn't want to hear about it. They have no real power to actually make professors do anything. Don't put on a fake smile, don't give them canned responses to their questions. Be raw, be real, until they understand your needs.

Happy S3-ing everyone!",Kathryn Linz
"#47709 In high school, I never realized how important social skills were because you could just do your own thing and still do well at competitions, school, etc. Here, being charismatic and socially skilled, will make it or break it. I have seen so many clubs and internships pass over perfectly qualified people and go for someone who has charisma instead of technical skill. The person I carried on every single pset beat me out for an internship somehow. The person who has had far few technical experiences still somehow surpassed me in the decision process. It's not that they're not qualified. I just wish I had the social ability to be that kind of person and it's frustrating to see my lack of social skill hold me back.","It‚Äôs not too late to develop those skills!

"#47708 I hear people complain a lot about S3 but honestly I've always had good experiences. The first time I went was in sophomore spring. Showed up, coughed once, counselor immediately latched onto it and offered me help getting psets extended and exams rescheduled on account of my ""cold"" (I did have a cold but it was already pretty much gone by the time I went to S3). Then I hit them up again in junior year to get some more extensions, and they helped me even though I was just overwhelmed and depressed and not physically sick. Then covid hit, I got migraines, and S3 helped me navigate synchronous attendance requirements that I couldn't fill due to light sensitivity with pretty much zero convincing necessary aside from ""I have migraines and zoom brings me physical pain please help me"". Walk-in every time, so I got different counselors to help me out, and every one of them was super nice; they didn't rush me along and listened to all my exhausted rambling then calmly helped me figure out a solution.

A counselor did tell me once that they were super happy to help because I hadn't used S3 very often and I was clearly not trying to ""abuse their service"". I think they do keep records of how often you visit, and they have a policy to be less lenient with people showing up every week. But I really don't get people who make up dead relatives and shit just to talk to S3. Is that really necessary? Just be honest about the series of events that have led you to S3. I find that they're generally sympathetic when you're raw and honest about what's going on, no exaggerating or sob story necessary. Helping students is literally their entire job.","I think you probably did a get a little lucky. I had one great experience at S^3 and one where I was told ‚Äúclearly you should have scheduled your grad school visits better‚Äù when I needed S^3 to get my professor in an attendance-requ

The professor required S^3 to excuse any absence so as to remove all headaches from his life, but wasn‚Äôt opposed to my absence otherwise, and the S^3 counselor clearly didn‚Äôt understand how grad visits work.

Then, after a hellish lab session trying not to get the equipment wet, walked back to my dorm and tried to tap in, before I realized that I was supposed to take a covid test that day. And the testing locations had closed while I was at lab. Then spent the next 30 minutes in the freezing rain trying to convince security to let me in, while they tried to find someone who knew what to do with an expired covid test because it was new back in the Fall and apparently nobody was properly trained to deal with covidpass.

Then I realized that dinner hours had passed and I had forgotten to grab lunch, like I usually would, due to my furious psetting. Or breakfast. Or any food since breakfast the day before because I like skipping lunch and the hellish exam was in full swing during dinner hours. And I had no sustenance in my room aside from whiskey and a pile of zero-sugar energy drinks because MIT forced me on the meal plan. So I drank some whiskey for the calories alone and went to bed.

I got wildly sick the next day of not-covid. Which is... good? Still had to isolate though.

And also I realized the next afternoon that I had slept through another assignment that was due at noon, that I had completely forgotten about in my cold, starving, exhausted stupor. Oops.

Now that, I'd say, is the most quintessential MIT experience I've ever had. 48+ hours of nothing but shitshow. Not to mention the absolute hell week I'd had prior, which was why I hadn't done any of those psets before the day they were due.","would really REALLY recommend grabbing cereal/fruit/

"#47700 Can MIT mental health prescribe medication after the first visit? I can barely make it until the appointment, I need to know if I should search elsewhere. I cannot function because I get panic attacks throughout the whole day and it's bad. Like bad bad. I need something to numb me down. If they don't prescribe what else is out there. The only thing I can think of that's easily accessible is alcohol but I don't really drink and don't want to start now.","In most states including MA, it is legal now for you to buy a cartridge of delta 8 thc at your local smoke shop","Hey OP, it is definitely possible to get a prescription on the first visit, but it depends on whether your clinician was able to get enough information on your case to make an informed decision on what to prescribe. Make sure to request meeting up with a psychiatrist. Not all medical personnel at Mental Health have a license to release prescriptions and it could save you an extra visit.
Since you mentioned alcohol, I also really encourage you to bring it up during your visit and make sure you understand how alcohol interacts with whatever you are prescribed. It can be life-threatenin
g to mix some panic attack/
anxiety meds with alcohol. I think it might be safer to refrain from self-medicating in the meantime. If you feel like you need to urgently talk to a mental health proffesional you can call Mental Health at 617-253-2916 during the day or 617-253-4481 during the nights and weekends.
I was able to get a prescription for panick attack meds on my first day and it went very smoothly, so it's definitely possible but not necessarily guaranteed. Feel free to dm me if you want to chat :)
Hope this was helpful and you'll get better soon!"

"#47681 Petition to name the 2021s ""the forgotten class"".

Sort of like the vibe of the lost generation, where ""lost"" referred to the disoriented, wandering, directionless nature of a post-WW1 coming-of-age.

We've been forgotten by our peers and our school. And on the flip side, we've started to forget our time in college since we only had 2.5 years of normalcy. We experience our coming-of-age in the shadow of a pandemic, swept along as debris in the tides of change.

It's kind of poetic, we left last March, some of us returned for the fall then got whisked away again in November, barely leaving a trace of our existence on campus. There were so few of us and nobody wanted to touch the fading posters, still advertising events from a more vibrant time.

Once we graduate, we'll have nothing but a piece of paper and our memories to prove that we ever existed here. No yearbook, no senior week, no tearful graduation photos.

The economy is in chaos, the job market and grad schools flooded. Many of us were forced to settle for jobs we didn't want, or worse, will graduate MIT entirely unemployed.

Many of us know someone who died to the virus. Yet the deaths feel purposeless and insignificant, dwarfed by the societal problems the pandemic has unearthed. There was no reason to drag this out so long.

The 2020s will forever be associated with a year of disaster, of chaos and upending. But at least they only lost 2 months. They'll be remembered through the tearful goodbyes in March, that we collectively recognized as a sort of final goodbye. The 2021s never got a goodbye. We were never sent off. We've been treated like burdens, an unfortunate class that complains too much, that the administration is all too happy to be rid of soon. Clear our plates of the 2021s, we'll start fresh next year.

We enter the world already forgotten.","To be fair, 2022s and 2023s also only had 2.5 years...",I love my 2021 friends!!! you guys deserved to be remembered!!! <3,Liam Ludington I‚Äôm convinced the entire world should‚Äôve taken a gap year this year,"If it makes you feel better, they didn't give a shit about me either",Neil nostalgic...,Haris Naseer,Ruhaan Chishti same

#47679 I just dropped a class to focus more on my physical and mental health. Even though I made the decision for me I can't shake the feelings of shame and disappointment in myself. I feel like such a failure because I gave up in the middle instead of grinding it out until the very end. I've been unsuccessful at convincing myself that putting myself before classes is not a sign of weakness... Please send some positive vibes,"Don't confuse ""need"" with ""weakness"". For example, we need oxygen to survive. Is it our weakness? No, it's just the way we are built. Similarly, having to put yourself first is a basic need just like breathing air is. So there is nothing weak about it.
Now you might tell me that others didn't need to drop classes. Everyone doesn't have the same needs. Sure everyone needs to put themselves first, but different people do that differently. So there is no reason to try to match your situation with anyone else's.
So look at the positive side and give yourself the credit. Yes, you deserve credit. From the information I have here, I can see that amidst all you troubles, you took the right decision to put yourself first. You had the courage to do it. Take your time and you can continue normally once you feel like it. Then, once you are back, there will be no sign of this ""dropping classes"" which means you will have overcome it completely.
And finally, grinding till the end is not always an option. You are a human, not a machine.","you shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù a reason to prioritize yourself (besides ur health + happiness), but ik it‚Äôs comforting to find one so here it is: if u work on ur physical and mental health now you‚Äôll be more prepared to take/retake that class in the future","Hey, similar situation here üôÇ

"#47659 Do any of you have a certain spot on campus that holds like a ridiculous amount of sentimental value? For me, it was a very specific part of Hayden Library: on the second floor, towards the entrance side, in the left-most single desk in front of the large window. That place saw me at the lowest of my lows and the highest of my highs, kept me on track with school, and always gave me hope about my future as I looked out towards the Boston skyline. I was pretty distraught when I saw that Hayden Library was being renovated, and that that desk may have been taken away from me. But now, I haven't worked there in almost a year and a half, and with the renovations still going on I just really hope I can get back to that spot before I graduate. Regardless, I will always have that in my memory and I am super grateful for it!

"#47642 Linguistics has given me so much insight into my communicative habits. A solid faction of the linguistics community frames communication as a game, where good-faith speakers and listeners presumably know the rules and try to find the most informative answer. The key here is ""good faith"", so the common assumption when people flagrantly violate the rules of the game is that they are playing the game in bad faith. When someone asks ""do you have the time?"", a good faith listener who knows the rules will subconsciously go through a series of recursive inferential steps to arrive at the answer ""3pm"", rather than ""yes"" (which is the naive, least-depth solution). This is typically so ingrained in human nature that it takes effort to undo the inferential process, and a bad-faith communicator actually spends more conscious effort to provide lower-utility answers like ""yes"". Similarly, terse mathematicians assume a level of inferential depth that is far too deep, and thus are generally unhelpful.

The problem arises when people don't know the rules of the game, or do not naturally undergo the same depth of recursive inference in communication. Inferential depth can be seen as a gausssian-esque distribution, with most people communicating at a similar depth but small parts of the population using substantially more or less depth, depending on their natural capacities and communicative environment growing up. However, these people are looped into the ""bad faith"" assumption, so people see them as assholes who exert extra effort just to be unhelpful. After studying linguistics, I've realized that I don't have a consistent inferential depth; I naturally often give responses that are either too shallow or too deep, and thus unhelpful to others. Consciously reasoning through all the steps is too much effort, but you can always be perceived as a good-faith (if slightly long-winded) communicator if you provide extra information. This has really helped me come to terms with my many past communication breakdowns, and has given me a good framework and motivation to become a better player, rather than just thinking ""everyone else is just a huge dick who is out to get me"".",this post has been diagnosed with Big Neurodivergent Energy,This is so beautiful tbh,Derek Yen,Vamshi Krishna,Fiona Cai

"#47633 Ok I don't expect people to be mindreaders or whatever, but I do believe my friends are extremely inconsiderate and make me feel bad about myself, and I do think mindreading is not necessary to notice that without saying anything. I'm not the most understanding person in the world, but knowing that my friends consider themselves very emotionally and socially intelligent, I must be an emotional and social fucking genius then because I never forget to be considerate and supportive towards them.

This is why I loved having no or almost no friends before coming to college, and I hate that I am stuck here and can't brake off anything because I live in a pod with them and see them every day. I'm perfectly fine being alone, and the only reason I chose to be friends with them is because I thought that it could be something wonderful, that I finally found people who I can vibe with. But having handled bullshit from people my entire life, I literally can't stand this anymore; it makes me phisically sick. There is no drama or fighting or love triangles or any crap like that; I just didn't expect them to be such... bad people really.

I watched the online graduation for the 2020s last year and an online ceremony really doesn't do the trick.

"#47619 I've gone to every single recitation and tutorial so far in 6.033, completed every pre-recitation assignment, and they gave me a B in participation, while my friend in the same section as me hasn't attended a single tutorial since February, sleeps through half of each recitation, and got an A. Seems fair!","When I took it the grading was also very subjective. Honestly, OP, put it on P/NE. You'll thank me later.","Not a 6.033 TA right now, but have been in the past---particip

"#47616 I find 3.091 this semester ridiculous. The syllabus does not correctly reflect what is on the lectures, the set of topics covered by lectures and the set of topics covered by the readings are different, but any topic on lectures/readings appearing on quizzes is fair game. The topics going to be covered in quizzes and exams are never well-defined. Only one practice exam is released three days prior to the exam with no solutions. I'm only taking this class to satisfy my GIR's and I can't believe studying for the weekly quizzes and the exams made this class literally my most time-consuming class this semester."

"#47471 About 6.031:
It‚Äôs a really bad feeling knowing that you missed part of class for something outside of your control. I know that 5 classwork grades are dropped ‚Äî but I did not plan to use my drop today. In preZoom for homework drops, etc, it is always in your control ‚Äî if you did badly, you drop; if you don‚Äôt have time to do it, you drop. It‚Äôs never the case that if something happens outside of your control you drop.

What if my wifi breaks again? What if it breaks 6 times throughout the rest of the semester? What if I‚Äôm not allowed to be on campus so I don‚Äôt have as great wifi as everyone else? What if my classmates can not show up to 5 classes and drop those but i can barely keep my wifi working? Seems unfair :( and sad :(

Also why on earth isnt this class recorded"
#47469 i get that some instructors/ta's don't like having office hours the day a pset is due because (a) they're trying to make us manage our time and (b) they don't want to face an onslaught of stressed out students on a tight deadline but tbh it's a lil dirty of them to do so

"#47311 I have never felt so shitty in my life. I have a major breakdown every other day and I can't keep up with my work. And whenever I do get some free time, I feel even shittier and I need to work in order to distract myself.

I've been seeing a therapist for over a year, attending many workshops to help develop healthy coping skills and process my trauma. I hoped that moving on campus would make things better, but I've been more isolated and generally felt shittier than ever. I enjoy my classes and the work I'm doing, but I have been contemplating suicide every single day for the past few months.

It's so hard to do anything, and I have no close friends or family, or even home. I literally don't know what to do anymore."

#47274 Where the fuck am I supposed to get 6.08 help? I can't make the evening office hours because of mandatory lectures during those times. The Sunday OH are always stacked. The lab hours can't be used for exercise help. The staff always offer the most miniscule hint and then pat themselves on the back leaving you in the same position you were previously. The piazza is the same. The class just throws a bunch of material at you without preparation and pretends that this is okay. There's pretty much no instruction communication between students and staff. Why did everyone say this was such a great course.
"#47273 I don't have impostor syndrome, but some kids at MIT really make me feel jealous. I was working on a pset a few days back and this shit took me 12 hours to complete because the problems required so much thinking and everything. Knowing that it would take long, I did the problem set well in advance. On the other hand, a friend of mine finished the pset within 2 hours, literally right before its due. I warned him about it and he replied ""those psets are so easy, I finish them in no time."" It's honestly so annoying and so unfair that certain people don't really even need to work hard to get the same results as me, someone who regularly busts my ass off. Like this dude is rarely ever doing his work and zooms through it before the deadline, whereas I'm planning out weeks in advance methods to get all my psets done. It just pisses me off that I have to work like 5x harder to achieve the same results."

Saying if you're not familiar to the area and that is my work to figure it out is easier said than done. So many paths and doors are closed.

The goose didn't die but was struggling to move between the two lanes on one side of the street. It was a pretty bad scene. And cars would try to move to the sides around it or stop. It was freaking out many drivers. I called MIT police to report it and told them they needed to move the goose immediately or it would cause an accident, to which they replied ""sorry, memorial drive is outside our jurisdiction"". So all those times they told us to call them first before the city/state police, what was the point? Eventually a state police came to move the goose and animal control services took it away a while after.
